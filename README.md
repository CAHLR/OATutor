# OpenITS

## Usage: 
```
git clone https://github.com/CAHLR/OpenITS
cd OpenITS
npm install
npm start
```
After compiling, the project will display in a new web browser tab at adress `localhost:3000`.

Create a file `/src/ProblemLogic/credentials.js`. It must be in the following format:

```javascript
const config = {};
export default config;
```

## Firebase
OpenITS uses Firebase for data logging purposes.
1. Navigate to the Firebase [website](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Add new project. Configure it as you wish (the options are not important for setup)
3. Click on Database and then create database. Start in test mode, leave the cloud location as is
4. Click `start collection` and name it `problemSubmissions`. Add a temporary first document for now.
5. Click on settings --> service accounts. Generate a new `Node.js` private key.
6. Put that private key in the below format in `/src/ProblemLogic/credentials.js`

```javascript
const config = {
  apiKey: "[apikey]",
  authDomain: "[projId].firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://[projId].firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "[projId]",
  storageBucket: "[projId].appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "[messagingSenderId]",
  appId: "[appId]",
  measurementId: "[measurementId]"
};

export default config;
```

## Features in progress:
1) Scaffolding/hint system - modularize the type of help 
2) Adaptive item selection - Pick items to master weakest skills (isolate skills to master individually)
3) Centralized skill model - `src/ProblemPool/skillMode.js` 
4) Data logging/collection - Based off of the Cognitive Tutor KDD dataset.
5) User login/registration - Cookie cache based

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: ReactJS
	* Theme: Material UI
    * Database: Firebase (Cloud Firestore)
	* Deployment: TBD
* Offline Computation/Iteration:
	* Python (dAFM Machine Learning algorithm)

# Project Structure: 
Code for this project is located in the `src` directory. 

## src

- `App.css`: Top level style sheet, contains colors for headers/logo
- `App.js`: Top level script, generates cookie/userID.
- `Platform.js`: Creates top "AppBar" and presents the first "problem" (everything under the app bar is part of the problem component)
- `index.js`: Renders `App.js`

## BKT

- `BKTBrains.js`: Contains `update` function that implements the standard BKT update algorithm.

## ProblemLayout

- `HintSystem.js`: Expandable panel component to display all the hints.

- `HintTextbox.js`: Textbox for scaffold types of hints with answers.

- `Problem.js`: The "problem" component created in App.js. The component is initailized with a "problem" object as one of its props. It then creates a series of "ProblemCards" in `const parts` (currently keys for ProblemCard components are random values, should be UUIDs in the future). 

	The `answerMade` function is passed to each ProblemCard component and is called whenever an answer is submitted to a ProblemCard. This enables the Problem component to update the knowledge component variables after each answer and transition to the next problem after all answers are correct. 
	
- `ProblemCard.js`: This component displays an individual card, updates the input text field to display the result of an answer attempt, and calls the `Problem.js` 	`answerMade` function when the submit button is pressed.  

These two files heavily rely on Material-UI syntax (eg. all the `useStyles` and `classes` references). Check their website for more info on this syntax. 

- `problemCardStyles.js`: This file contains all the styles for `ProblemCard.js`


## ProblemLogic
- `checkAnswer.js`: Function to check answers. 3 different types of answers are supported: Algebraic, String, Numeric. Algebraic will simplify numeric expressions, numeric checks numeric equivalence, string requires answers to exactly match.

- `problemIndex.js`: Imports all of the problem files and stores them in `const problemIndex`. The function `nextProblem` is used to determine the next problem to be displayed. 

- `Firebase.js`: Class with methods to read/write to Firebase (Cloud Firestore).


## ProblemPool [Configurable]
- Each problem is contained in its own folder. 
- Problems can contain steps which are contained in their own subfolder
- Steps can contain hints which are stored as pathways in the `tutoring` subfolder
- Files ending in `-index.js` are autogenerated

## Config [Configurable]
- `config.js`: Central place where options can be configured

- `treatmentAssigner.js`: Function that given the UserID, return the appropriate treatment (Ex. BKTParam, HintPathway, Adaptive Problem selection heuristic)

- `./bktParams/bktParams.js`: Contains the mastery, transit, slip, and guess probabilities for each skill. Used in the BKT model.

- `./hintPathways/hintPathway.js`: Contains the preferred hint pathway to use.

- `./problemSelectHeuristics/problemSelectHeuristic.js`: This file contains a configurable heuristic for adaptive problem selection. The default heuristic iterates across the problems and chooses the one with the lowest average probability of mastery across all of its knowledge components, but this can be changed to any heuristic. 

- `skillModel.js`: This file contains all the problem to skill mappings. The format is as follows:
```javascript
    problemID1a: []
    problemID1b: []
    ...
    problemID1z: []
    
    problemID9a: []
    ...
    problemID9z: []
    ...
```

- `credentials.js`: File which contains the credentials to authenticate to Firebase. (Note: this file is ignored in the gitignore by default to prevent API key leaks.)

- `algebraCheck.js`: Config file for algebraic answer checks
