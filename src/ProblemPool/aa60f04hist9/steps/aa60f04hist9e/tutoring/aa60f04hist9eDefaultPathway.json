(Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times an answer occurs.) If: \\\\n f $$=$$ frequency \\\\n n $$=$$ total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and \\\\n RF $$=$$ relative frequency, \\\\n then: $$RF=$$ $$\\frac{f}{n}$$ \\\\n For example, if three students in Mr. Ahab's English class of 40 students received from 90% to 100%, then, f $$=$$ 3, n $$=$$ 40, and $$RF=$$ $$\\frac{3}{40}=0.075$$ \\\\n",
