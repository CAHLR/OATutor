        "text": "The relative frequency is equal to the frequency for an observed value of the data divided by the total number of data values in the sample. (Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times an answer occurs.) If: f $$=$$ frequency n $$=$$ total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and RF $$=$$ relative frequency, then: $$RF=$$ $$\\frac{f}{n}$$ For example, if three students in Mr. Ahab's English class of 40 students received from 90% to 100%, then, f $$=$$ 3, n $$=$$ 40, and $$RF=$$ $$\\frac{3}{40}=0.075$$",
