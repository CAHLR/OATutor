(Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times an answer occurs.) If:\\nf $$=$$ frequency\\n$$n$$ $$=$$ total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and\\nRF $$=$$ relative frequency,\\nthen: $$RF=$$ $$\\frac{f}{n}$$\\nFor example, if three students in Mr. Ahab's English class of $$40$$ students received from 90% to 100%, then, f $$=$$ $$3$$, $$n$$ $$=$$ $$40$$, and $$RF=$$ $$\\frac{3}{40}=0.075$$ |newline|",
