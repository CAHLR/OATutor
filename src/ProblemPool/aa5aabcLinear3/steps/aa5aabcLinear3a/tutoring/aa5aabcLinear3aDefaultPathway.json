        "text": "To determine whether the value $$y=\\frac{4}{3}$$ is a solution to the equation $$9y+2=6y+3$$, we can substitute $$\\frac{4}{3}$$ for $$y$$ in the equation and see if it holds true. Substituting $$\\frac{4}{3}$$ for $$y$$ in the equation gives us: $$9\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)+2=6\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)+3$$ Simplifying this expression gives us: $$12+2=8+3$$ Which simplifies to: $$14=11$$ Since 14 does not equal 11, $$y=\\frac{4}{3}$$ is not a solution to the equation $$9y+2=6y+3$$.",
