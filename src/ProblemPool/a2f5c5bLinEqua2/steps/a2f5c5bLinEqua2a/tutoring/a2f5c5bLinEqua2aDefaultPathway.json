        "text": "The equation of a line is typically given in the form \"y=mx+b\", where $$m$$ is the slope of the line and $$b$$ is the y-intercept (i.e., the point at which the line crosses the y-axis). To find the equation of a line that passes through the given points $$(1,-3)$$ and $$(1,4)$$, we can use the slope formula:\\n$$\\frac{4-\\left(-3\\right)}{1-1}=m$$\\nThe slope of the line is therefore $$7$$. However, since the two given points have the same x-coordinate (i.e.,1), the line is a vertical line rather than a regular line with a slope. The equation of a vertical line is of the form $$\"x=a\"$$, where a is the x-coordinate of all the points on the line. In this case, the equation of the line is $$\"x=1\"$$.",
