By the way the situation is presented, it is fairly clear that a school offering fruit in their lunch should be considered a win. This is because the probability of having fruit in school lunches was brought up before the probability of not having fruit in school lunches. In addition, this means that a \\\"failure\\\" would be a school lunch not having fruit.",
