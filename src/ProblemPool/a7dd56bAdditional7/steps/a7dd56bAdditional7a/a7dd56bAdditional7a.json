        "At the 5% significance level, we conclude that Jeffrey swims faster using the new goggles. The sample data show there is sufficient evidence that Jeffrey's mean time to swim the $$25-yard$$ freestyle is less than $$16.43$$ seconds."

    "stepTitle": "Jeffrey, as an eight-year old, established a mean time of $$16.43$$ seconds for swimming the 25-yard freestyle, with a standard deviation of $$0.8$$ seconds. His dad, Frank, thought that Jeffrey could swim the 25-yard freestyle faster using goggles. Frank bought Jeffrey a new pair of expensive goggles and timed Jeffrey for $$15$$ 25-yard freestyle swims. For the $$15$$ swims, Jeffrey's mean time was $$16$$ seconds. Frank thought that the goggles helped Jeffrey to swim faster than the $$16.43$$ seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset $$\\alpha=0.05$$. Assume that the swim times for the 25-yard freestyle are normal.",
