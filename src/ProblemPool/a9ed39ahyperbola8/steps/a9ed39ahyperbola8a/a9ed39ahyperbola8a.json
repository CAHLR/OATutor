    "stepTitle": "The design layout of a cooling tower is shown in the picture. The tower stands 167.082 meters tall. The diameter of the top is 60 meters. At their closest, the sides of the tower are 40 meters apart. Find the equation of the hyperbola that models the sides of the cooling tower. Assume that the center of the hyperbola\u2014indicated by the intersection of dashed perpendicular lines in the figure\u2014is the origin of the coordinate plane. Round final values to four decimal places.",
