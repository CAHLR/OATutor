        "text": "To solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable $$x$$ on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add $$34$$ to both sides of the equation:\\n$$x+16+34=-34+34$$\\nCombining like terms, we get:\\n$$x+50=0$$\\nThen, we can subtract $$50$$ from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable x:\\n$$x+50-50=0-50$$\\n$$x=-50$$\\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $$x=-50$$.",
