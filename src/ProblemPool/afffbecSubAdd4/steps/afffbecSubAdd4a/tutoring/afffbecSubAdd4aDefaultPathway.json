        "text": "To solve this equation, we need to isolate the variable $$x$$ on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 34 to both sides of the equation: $$x+16+34=-34+34$$ Combining like terms, we get: $$x+50=0$$ Then, we can subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable x: $$x+50-50=0-50$$ $$x=-50$$ Therefore, the solution to the equation is $$x=-50$$.",
