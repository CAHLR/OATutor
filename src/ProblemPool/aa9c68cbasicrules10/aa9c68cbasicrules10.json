    "body": "Studies show that about one woman in seven (approximately 14.3%) who live to be 90 will develop breast cancer. Suppose that of those women who develop breast cancer, a test is negative 2% of the time. Also suppose that in the general population of women, the test for breast cancer is negative about 85% of the time. Let B $$=$$ woman develops breast cancer and let N $$=$$ tests negative while P $$=$$ tests positive. Suppose one woman is selected at random.",
