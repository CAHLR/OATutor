Additionally, since we know the 25 bags cost $4.23 per bag, the total cost is $$25\\times4.23=105.75$$. Knowing this total cost, we can get our second equation: $$4.89a+3.79b=105.75$$.", variabilization: {}}, {id: "a381217systemeq24a-h2", type: "hint", dependencies: ["a381217systemeq24a-h1"], title: "How to Use the Systems of Equations", text: "Solve the two equations as a normal system of equations to find the values of the two variables.", variabilization: {}}, ]; export {hints};
