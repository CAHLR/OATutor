To notate these, we can define a coordinate system, identifying the “starting point” at the intersection where they both started. Then we can use the variable, A, which we introduced above, to represent Anna’s position, and define it to be a measurement from the starting point in the eastward direction. Likewise, can use the variable, E, to represent Emanuel’s position, measured from the starting point in the southward direction.
