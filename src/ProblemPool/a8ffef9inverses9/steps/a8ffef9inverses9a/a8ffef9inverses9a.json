    "stepTitle": "The function $$C=\\frac{20+0.4n}{100+n}$$ represents the concentration C of an acid solution after n mL of 40% solution has been added to 100 mL of a 20% solution. First, find the inverse of the function; that is, find an expression for n in terms of C. Then use your result to determine how much of the 40% solution should be added so that the final mixture is a 35% solution.",
