        "text": "The general process for finding an inverse is as follow: Given a polynomial function, restrict the domain of a function that is not one-to-one and then find the inverse. 1) Restrict the domain by determining a domain on which the original function is one-to-one. 2) Replace f(x) with y. 3) Interchange x and y. 4) Solve for y, and rename the function or pair of function $$f^{-1\\left(x\\right)}$$. 5) Revise the formula for $$f^{-1\\left(x\\right)}$$ by ensuring that the outputs of the inverse function correspond to the restricted domain of the original function. However, note that in real-world applications, we do not swap the variables when finding inverses. Instead, we change which variable is considered to be the independent variable.",
