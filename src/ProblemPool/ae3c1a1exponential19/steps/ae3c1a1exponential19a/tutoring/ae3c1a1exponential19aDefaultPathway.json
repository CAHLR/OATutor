        "text": "For all real numbers t, and all positive numbers a and r, continuous growth or decay is represented by the formula $$A(t)=a e^{r t}$$ where: a is the initial value, r is the continuous growth rate per unit time, and t is the elapsed time. If $$r>0$$ , then the formula represents continuous growth. If $$r<0$$ , then the formula represents continuous decay. For business applications, the continuous growth formula is called the continuous compounding formula and takes the form $$A(t)=P e^{r t}$$ where: P is the principal or the initial invested, r is the growth or interest rate per unit time, and t is the period or term of the investment.",
