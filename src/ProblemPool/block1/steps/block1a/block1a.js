Person X meets you in a public space, and he constructs transaction A, which sends you the agreed upon price. Since you paid attention in lecture, you ask him to wait until 10 block confirmations have passed before you hand off the sunglasses. Person X tells you that 100 minutes is a long time to wait, but that they have half an hour before their next meeting. Assume a block takes 10 minutes to be confirmed. Person X looks very official, and like they might have some governmental affiliations. If we assume conservatively that Person X could control 30% of the network, what is the fewest number of blocks we insist they wait for, so that the probability p of Person X achieving a longer chain and being able to reverse the transaction is<0.1%?", answerType: "arithmetic", hints: hints}; export {step};
