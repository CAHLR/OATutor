First, find the inverse of the function; that is, find an expression for n in terms of C. Then use your result to determine how much of the 40% solution should be added so that the final mixture is a 35% solution.", stepBody: "", answerType: "arithmetic", hints: hints, variabilization: {}}; export {step};
