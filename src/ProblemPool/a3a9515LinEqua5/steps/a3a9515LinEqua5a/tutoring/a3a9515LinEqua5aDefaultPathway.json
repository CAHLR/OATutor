        "text": "The slope-intercept form of a line is given by: $$y=mx+b$$ where m is the slope of the line and $$b$$ is the $$y-intercept$$, which is the point where the line crosses the $$y-axis$$. Given that $$m=4$$ and the point (2,5) lies on the line, we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for b: $$5=4\\times2+b$$ Solving this equation gives us $$b=-3$$, so the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is: $$y=4x-3$$ This means that for any value of $$x$$, we can find the corresponding value of $$y$$ by plugging $$x$$ into the equation. For example, if $$x=1$$, then $$y$$ $$=$$ $$4\\times1-3=1$$.",
