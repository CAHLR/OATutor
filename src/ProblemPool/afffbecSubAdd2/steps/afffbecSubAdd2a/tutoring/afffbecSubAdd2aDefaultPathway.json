        "text": "To solve the equation $$b-0.47=-2.1$$, we need to isolate the variable $$b$$ on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add 0.47 to both sides of the equation to get: $$b-0.47+0.47=-2.1+0.47$$ Combining like terms on the left side of the equation gives: $$b=-1.63$$ So the solution to the equation is $$b=-1.63$$.",
