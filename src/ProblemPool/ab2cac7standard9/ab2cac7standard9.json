Male heights are known to follow a normal distribution. Let $$X=the$$ height of a $$15$$ to 18-year-old male from Chile in $$2009$$ to $$2010$$. Then X~N(170, $$6.28)$$. Suppose a $$15$$ to 18-year-old male from Chile was $$168$$ cm tall from $$2009$$ to $$2010$$. The $$z-score$$ when $$x=168$$ cm is $$z=___$$. This $$z-score$$ tells you that $$x=168$$ is $$___$$ standard deviations to the $$___$$ (right or left) of the mean $$___$$ (What is the mean?).",
