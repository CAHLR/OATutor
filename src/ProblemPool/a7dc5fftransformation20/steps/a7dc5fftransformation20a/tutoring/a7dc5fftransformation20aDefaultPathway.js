Horizontal shifts are denoted as addition (shift to the left) or subtraction (shift to the right) inside of the parentheses. Because x is being squared in this function, we need to add the shift to x before it is squared. To shift four units to the left, we add four to x in the denominator, then square that value.", variabilization: {}}, {id: "a7dc5fftransformation20a-h2", type: "scaffold", problemType: "MultipleChoice", answerType: "string", hintAnswer: ["$$\\frac{1}{{\\left(x-3\\right)}^2}$$"], dependencies: ["a7dc5fftransformation20a-h1"], title: "Horizontal Shift", text: "What does the function look like now?", choices: ["$$\\frac{1}{{\\left(x+3\\right)}^2}$$", "$$\\frac{1}{{\\left(x-3\\right)}^2}$$"], variabilization: {}}, {id: "a7dc5fftransformation20a-h3", type: "hint", dependencies: ["a7dc5fftransformation20a-h2"], title: "Vertical Shift", text: "Vertical shifts denoted as addition (shift upwards) or subtraction (shift downwards) outside of the fraction.
