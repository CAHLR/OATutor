        "text": "To determine whether the value $$y=\\frac{1}{3}$$ is a solution to the equation $$9y+2=6y+3$$, we can substitute $$\\frac{1}{3}$$ in for $$y$$ in the equation and see if the resulting equation is true. Substituting $$\\frac{1}{3}$$ in for $$y$$ in the equation $$9y+2=6y+3$$, we get: $$9\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+2=6\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+3$$ Simplifying this equation, we get: $$3+2=2+3$$ This equation is true, so $$y=\\frac{1}{3}$$ is a solution to the equation $$9y+2=6y+3$$.",
