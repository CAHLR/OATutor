Therefore, you know that the two separate groups are high school female teachers and high school male teachers. To decide whether this is stratified or cluster sampling, we must think about whether every group is represented in the sample. Choose STRATIFIED if a proportion of each separate group is included in the final sample; choose CLUSTER if not all the groups are included in the final sample, but every member of the selected groups are.",
