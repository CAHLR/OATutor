If A and C are nonzero, have the same sign, and are not equal to each other, then the graph may be an ellipse. \\n b. If A and C are equal and nonzero and have the same sign, then the graph may be a circle. \\n c. If A and C are nonzero and have opposite signs, then the graph may be a hyperbola. \\n d. If either A or C is zero, then the graph may be a parabola. \\n If $$B=0$$, the conic section will have a vertical and/or horizontal axes. If B does not equal 0, as shown below, the conic section is rotated. Notice the phrase “may be” in the definitions. That is because the equation may not represent a conic section at all, depending on the values of A, B, C, D, E, and F. For example, the degenerate case of a circle or an ellipse is a point: \\n $$A x^2+B y^2=0$$, when A and B have the same sign. \\n The degenerate case of a hyperbola is two intersecting straight lines: $$A x^2+B y^2=0$$, when A and B have opposite signs. \\n On the other hand, the equation, $$A x^2+B y^2+\\left(1\\right)=0$$, when A and B are positive does not represent a graph at all, since there are no real ordered pairs which satisfy it.", variabilization: {}}, {id: "a5c2168rotation1b-h2", type: "hint", dependencies: ["a5c2168rotation1b-h1"], title: "General Form", text: "Referring to the general form $$A x^2+B x y+C y^2+D x+E y+F=0$$, we can identify the type of conic by comparing the coefficients.", variabilization: {}}, {id: "a5c2168rotation1b-h3", type: "scaffold", problemType: "TextBox", answerType: "arithmetic", hintAnswer: ["0"], dependencies: ["a5c2168rotation1b-h2"], title: "General Form", text: "What is the coefficient of $$x^2$$, A, equals to?", variabilization: {}}, {id: "a5c2168rotation1b-h4", type: "scaffold", problemType: "TextBox", answerType: "arithmetic", hintAnswer: ["9"], dependencies: ["a5c2168rotation1b-h3"], title: "General Form", text: "What is the coefficient of $$y^2$$, C, equals to?", variabilization: {}}, {id: "a5c2168rotation1b-h5", type: "scaffold", problemType: "MultipleChoice", answerType: "string", hintAnswer: ["Parabola"], dependencies: ["a5c2168rotation1b-h4"], title: "General Form", text: "We notice that A is zero.
