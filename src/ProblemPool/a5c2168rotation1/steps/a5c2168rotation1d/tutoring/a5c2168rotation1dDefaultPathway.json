        "text": "1) Rewrite the equation in the general form, $$A x^2+B x y+C y^2+D x+E y+F=0$$. 2) Identify the values of A and C from the general form. a. If A and C are nonzero, have the same sign, and are not equal to each other, then the graph may be an ellipse. b. If A and C are equal and nonzero and have the same sign, then the graph may be a circle. c. If A and C are nonzero and have opposite signs, then the graph may be a hyperbola. d. If either A or C is zero, then the graph may be a parabola. If $$B=0$$, the conic section will have a vertical and/or horizontal axes. If B does not equal 0, as shown below, the conic section is rotated. Notice the phrase \u201cmay be\u201d in the definitions. That is because the equation may not represent a conic section at all, depending on the values of A, B, C, D, E, and F. For example, the degenerate case of a circle or an ellipse is a point: $$A x^2+B y^2=0$$, when A and B have the same sign. The degenerate case of a hyperbola is two intersecting straight lines: $$A x^2+B y^2=0$$, when A and B have opposite signs. On the other hand, the equation, $$A x^2+B y^2+1=0$$, when A and B are positive does not represent a graph at all, since there are no real ordered pairs which satisfy it.",
