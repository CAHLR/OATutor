    "body": "Suppose we are playing the lucky dice game. The rules of the game are as follows: First, each player selects any number from 1-6. Next, each player will roll 3 dice and count how times each dice matched their lucky number. 1 correct guess will result in 1 point. This process will then be repeated as many times are you want (Typically 3-10 times), and the highest scoring player wins.",
