Think about the strategy we used to find the value of the handful of coins. The first thing we need is to notice what type of coins are involved. Alison has dimes and quarters. Create a table to organize the $$information$$ where the columns indicate the type of coin and the rows include the number of coins, their value, and their total value when multiplied. We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we'll do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign in the tail as a reminder. The value of a dime is $0.10 and the value of a quarter is $0.25. The total value of all the coins is $9.35."}, {id: "SolveMixture12a-h2", type: "hint", dependencies: ["SolveMixture12a-h1"], title: "Identify and Name the Unknowns", text: "Choose a variable to represent the quantity for which we are looking for.
