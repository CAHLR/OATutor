        "text": "To determine whether a given value is a solution to a given equation, you can substitute the value into the equation in place of the variable and see whether the equation is satisfied.\\nSo, if we substitute $$y=\\frac{7}{5}$$ into the equation $$5y+3=10y-4$$, we get:\\n$$5\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)+3=\\operatorname{10}\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)-4$$\\n$$\\frac{35}{5}+3=\\frac{70}{5}-4$$\\n$$\\frac{35}{5}+3=14-4$$\\n$$\\frac{35}{5}+3=10$$\\n$$\\frac{35+15}{5}=10$$\\n$$\\frac{50}{5}=10$$\\n$$10=10$$\\nSince the equation is satisfied when $$y=\\frac{7}{5}$$, this value is indeed a solution to the equation.",
