        "text": "To determine whether a given value is a solution to a given equation, you can substitute the value into the equation in place of the variable and see whether the equation is satisfied. So, if we substitute $$y=\\frac{7}{5}$$ into the equation $$5y+3=10y-4$$, we get: $$5\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)+3=\\operatorname{10}\\left(\\frac{7}{5}\\right)-4$$ $$\\frac{35}{5}+3=\\frac{70}{5}-4$$ $$\\frac{35}{5}+3=14-4$$ $$\\frac{35}{5}+3=10$$ $$\\frac{35+15}{5}=10$$ $$\\frac{50}{5}=10$$ $$10=10$$ Since the equation is satisfied when $$y=\\frac{7}{5}$$, this value is indeed a solution to the equation.",
