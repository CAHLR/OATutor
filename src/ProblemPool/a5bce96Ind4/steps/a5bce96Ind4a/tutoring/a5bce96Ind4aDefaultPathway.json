        "text": "To get at least one tail, there are three possible outcomes: HT, TH, and TT. The probability of getting HT and TH is $$2\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$$. The probability of getting TT is $$\\frac{1}{4}$$. Therefore, the probability of getting at least one tail is $$\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$$. The probability that both faces are the same is $$\\frac{1}{2}$$. Therefore, the probability that we get at least one tail and both faces are the same is $$\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{4}$$.",
