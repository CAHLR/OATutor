Sometimes it can be hard to pin point the key alternative hypothesis like in this case because the traveler only \"doubts\" the claim which would lead us to believe that the alternative hypothesis would be that the variance isn't equal to 150. However, the \"no more than 150\" claim by the airline is the most clear message that the null hypothesis is that the variance is less than or equal to 150, therefore we should model our hypotheses off of airline's null claim.",
