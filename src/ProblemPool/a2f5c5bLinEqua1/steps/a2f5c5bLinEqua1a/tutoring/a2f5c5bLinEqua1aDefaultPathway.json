        "text": "To find the equation of the line that passes through the points $$(-5,2)$$ and $$(2,2)$$, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The point-slope form is:\\n$$y-y1=m(x-x1)$$\\nwhere (x1,y1) is a point on the line, and $$m$$ is the slope of the line.\\nTo find the slope, we can use the formula:\\n$$m=\\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$$\\nPlugging in the coordinates of the two points we are given, we get:\\n$$m=\\frac{2-2}{2-\\left(-5\\right)}$$\\n$$m=\\frac{0}{7}$$\\n$$m=0$$\\nSince the slope is $$0$$, the line is horizontal. Any point on the line will have the same y-coordinate as the given points. So, we can use either of the given points to find the equation of the line.\\nUsing the point $$(-5,2)$$, we get:\\n$$y-2=0(x-(-5))$$\\n$$y=2$$\\nSo, the equation of the line is: $$y=2$$",
