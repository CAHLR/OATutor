        "text": "To find the equation of the line that passes through the points $$(-5,2)$$ and (2,2), we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The point-slope form is: $$y-y1=m(x-x1)$$ where (x1,y1) is a point on the line, and m is the slope of the line. To find the slope, we can use the formula: $$m=\\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$$ Plugging in the coordinates of the two points we are given, we get: $$m=\\frac{2-2}{2-\\left(-5\\right)}$$ $$m=\\frac{0}{7}$$ $$m=0$$ Since the slope is 0, the line is horizontal. Any point on the line will have the same $$y-coordinate$$ as the given points. So, we can use either of the given points to find the equation of the line. Using the point $$(-5,2)$$, we get: $$y-2=0(x-(-5))$$ $$y=2$$ So, the equation of the line is: $$y=2$$",
