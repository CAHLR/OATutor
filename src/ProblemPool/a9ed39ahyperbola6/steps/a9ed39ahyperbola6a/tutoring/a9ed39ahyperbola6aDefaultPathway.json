        "text": "The standard form of the equation of a hyperbola with center (h,k) and transverse axis parallel to the x-axis is $$\\frac{{\\left(x-h\\right)}^2}{a^2}-\\frac{{\\left(y-k\\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$ where the length of the transverse axis is 2a the coordinates of the vertices are (h+a,k),(h-a,k) the length of the conjugate axis is 2b the coordinates of the co-vertices are (h,k+b),(h,k-b) the distance between the foci is 2c, where $$c^2=a^2+b^2$$ the coordinates of the foci are (h+c,k),(h-c,k) The asymptotes of the hyperbola coincide with the diagonals of the central rectangle. The length of the rectangle is 2a and its width is 2b. The slopes of the diagonals are $$\\frac{b}{a}$$ and $$\\frac{-b}{a}$$, and each diagonal passes through the center (h,k). Using the point-slope formula, it is simple to show that the equations of the asymptotes are $$y=\\frac{b}{a} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$ and $$y=\\frac{-b}{a} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$. (See the left image) The standard form of the equation of a hyperbola with center (h,k) and transverse axis parallel to the y-axis is $$\\frac{{\\left(y-k\\right)}^2}{a^2}-\\frac{{\\left(x-h\\right)}^2}{b^2}=1$$ where the length of the transverse axis is 2a the coordinates of the vertices are (h,k+a),(h,k-a) the length of the conjugate axis is 2b the coordinates of the co-vertices are (h+b,k),(h-b,k) the distance between the foci is 2c, where $$c^2=a^2+b^2$$ the coordinates of the foci are (h,k+c),(h,k-c) Using the reasoning above, the equations of the asymptotes are $$y=\\frac{a}{b} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$ and $$y=\\frac{-a}{b} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$.\\n##figure1.gif##",
