Adapted from the OPA website, the table below displays the numbers of degree recipients in three majors in the academic years 2008-2009 and 2017-2018. Suppose you want to find the biggest absolute difference between the numbers of degree recipients in the two years, among the three majors. Compute this value and call it biggest_change. Use a single expression (a single line of code) to compute the answer. Let Python perform all the arithmetic (like subtracting 49 from 67) rather than simplifying the expression yourself.\n##figure1.gif", steps: steps, variabilization: {}}; export { problem };
