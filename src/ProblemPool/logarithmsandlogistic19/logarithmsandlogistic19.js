Data from 2,871 crashes were used to measure the association of a personâ€™s blood alcohol level (BAC) with the risk of being in an accident. The attached table shows results from the study. The relative risk is a measure of how many times more likely a person is to crash. So, for example, a person with a BAC of 0.09 is 3.54 times as likely to crash as a person who has not been drinking alcohol.\n##figure2.gif", steps: steps, variabilization: {}, oer: "https://openstax.org/", courseName: "Openstax: College Algebra"}; export { problem };
