        "text": "To solve the equation using the subtraction and addition properties of equality, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. To do this, we can use the subtraction property of equality $$by$$ subtracting 0.52 from both sides of the equation: $$z+0.52-0.52=-8.5-0.52$$ $$z=-9.02$$ Therefore, the solution to the equation is $$z=-9.02$$.",
