    "body": "Two coworkers commute from the same building. They are interested in whether or not there is any variation in the time it takes them to drive to work. They each record their times for $$20$$ commutes. The first worker\u2019s times have a variance of $$12.1$$. The second worker\u2019s times have a variance of $$16.9$$. The first worker thinks that he is more consistent with his commute times. Test the claim at the 10% level. Assume that commute times are normally distributed.",
