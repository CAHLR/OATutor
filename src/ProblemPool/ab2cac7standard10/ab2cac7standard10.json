Let $$X=the$$ height of a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile in 2009 to 2010. Then X~N(170, 6.28). Suppose that the height of a 15 to 18-year-old male from Chile from 2009 to 2010 has a z-score of $$z=1.27$$. What is the male\u2019s height? The z-score $$(z=1.27)$$ tells you that the male\u2019s height is $$___$$ standard deviations to the $$___$$ (right or left) of the mean.",
