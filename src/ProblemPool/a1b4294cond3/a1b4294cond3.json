    "body": "A hospital is testing patients for a certain disease. If a patient has the disease, the test is designed to return a positive result. If a patient does not have the disease, the test should return a negative result. No test is perfect though: 99% percent of patients who have the disease will test positive, 5% percent of patients who don't have the disease will also test positive, 10% percent of the population in question has the disease.",
