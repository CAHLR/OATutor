        "text": "Make sure all the word and ideas are understood. Determine the types of coins involved. Think about the strategy we used to find the value of the handful of coins. The first thing we need is to notice what type of coins are involved. Adalberto has dimes and nickels. Create a table to organize the information where the columns indicate the type of coin and the rows include the number of coins, their value, and their total value when multiplied. We can work this problem all in cents or in dollars. Here we'll do it in dollars and put in the dollar sign in the tail as a reminder. The value of a dime is $$\\$0.10$$ and the value of a nickel is $$\\$0.05$$. The total value of all the coins is $$\\$2.25$$.",
