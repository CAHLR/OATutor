Therefore, it must either be systematic or simple random from process of elimination. The definition of a systematic sample is randomly selecting a strating point and take the nth piece of data from the population. The definition of simple random sampling is fairly selecting a group of size n from the population so every individual has the same chance of being selected. Which one sounds the most like the librarian's selection method?",
