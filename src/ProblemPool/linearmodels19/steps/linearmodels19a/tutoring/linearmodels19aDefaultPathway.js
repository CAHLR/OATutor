What this means is that the line we want to find also has a slope of 2. Since we know the slope of the line and a point on the line, we can plug this into the equation $$y=mx+b$$ to find b. We know that the point (2,7) means $$y=7$$ and $$x=2$$, and the slope, m, is 2. Thus, $$7=\\left(2\\right) \\left(2\\right)+b$$. Solving for b, we get that $$b=3$$.
