    "body": "Suppose we are playing the lucky dice game. The rules of the game are as follows: First, each player selects any number from $$1-6$$. Next, each player will roll $$3$$ dice and count how times each dice matched their lucky number. $$1$$ correct guess will result in $$1$$ point. This process will then be repeated as many times are you want (Typically $$3-10$$ times), and the highest scoring player wins.",
