        "text": "To solve this equation, you need to isolate the a term. You can start $$by$$ subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation to obtain: $$5(a-3)=-10-5$$ Then, you can simplify the left-hand side of the equation $$by$$ using the distributive property: $$5a-15=-10-5$$ Combining the constants on the right-hand side, we have: $$5a-15=-15$$ Finally, you can add 15 to both sides of the equation to isolate the a term: $$5a=0$$ Then, divide both sides of the equation $$by$$ 5 to find the value of a: $$a=\\frac{0}{5}$$ Thus, $$a=0$$.",
