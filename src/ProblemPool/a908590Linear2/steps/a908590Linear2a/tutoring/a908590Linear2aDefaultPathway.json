        "text": "To solve this equation, you need to isolate the a term. You can start by subtracting $$5$$ from both sides of the equation to obtain:\\n$$5(a-3)=-10-5$$\\nThen, you can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by using the distributive property:\\n$$5a-15=-10-5$$\\nCombining the constants on the right-hand side, we have:\\n$$5a-15=-15$$\\nFinally, you can add $$15$$ to both sides of the equation to isolate the a term:\\n$$5a=0$$\\nThen, divide both sides of the equation by $$5$$ to find the value of a:\\n$$a=\\frac{0}{5}$$\\nThus, $$a=0$$.",
