This means that once a card is chosen and removed from the deck, it is not put back in the deck before the next card is chosen. Therefore, the number of cards in the deck decreases as each card is chosen. In this case, the first card is chosen from a deck of $$52$$ cards, the second card is chosen from a deck of $$51$$ cards, and the third card is chosen from a deck of $$50$$ cards.",
