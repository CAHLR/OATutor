As a privacy-centric person, you decide to conduct your transactions on ZCash. In particular, you’re wary of people knowing who you’re transacting with, and the amounts you’re transacting. But ZCash offers a zk-SNARK proof, verifying your transaction validity and obfuscating your transaction data! You and your business partner Person X are interested in how long your transactions are taking on client version ZCash 2.0.4. You construct a transaction, and sign it such that it can only be viewed by Person X. You send it off and record that it took A seconds, but belatedly realize that you’ve sent it instead to your friend Person J instead. No problem, since the transaction wasn’t signed for Person J’s viewing. You send it to Person X, and record that it took B seconds, where B>A. You try it a few more times, and have Person X try forwarding the transaction you constructed as well -- together you realize this is a consistent feature. Are the privacy features about your transactions compromised? Does this feature violate our privacy assumptions?", choices: ["Yes", "No"], answerType: "string", hints: hints}; export {step};
