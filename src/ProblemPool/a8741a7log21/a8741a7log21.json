    "body": "Extended exposures to noice that measures $$85$$ dB (decibels) can cause permanent damage to the inner ear which will result in hearing loss. Use the formula: The loudness level, D, measured in decibels, of a sound of intensity, I, measured in watts per square inch is $$D=10*\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{{10}^{\\left(-12\\right)}}\\right)$$.",
