    "body": "The Rational Zero Theorem states that, if the polynomial $$f(x)=a_n x^n+a_n$$ - 1*x**(n - 1)+...+a_1*x+a_0 has integer coefficients, then every rational zero of f(x) has the form $$\\frac{p}{q}$$ where p is a factor of the constant term $$a_0$$ and q is a factor of the leading coefficient $$a_n$$. When the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational zeros are the factors of the constant term.",
