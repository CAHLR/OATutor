    "body": "UCLA conducted a survey of more than 263,000 college freshmen from 385 colleges in fall 2005. The results of students' expected majors by gender were reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education $$\\frac{\\frac{2}{2}}{2006}$$. Suppose a survey of 5,000 graduating females and 5,000 graduating males was done as a follow-up last year to determine what their actual majors were. The results are shown in the tables for Exercise 11.77 and Exercise 11.78. The second column in each table does not add to 100% because of rounding.",
