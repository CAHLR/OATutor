The volume of the cone in terms of the radius is given by $$V=\\frac{2}{3} p r^3$$. (p $$=$$ pi) Find the inverse of the function $$V=\\frac{2}{3} p r^3$$ that determines the volume V of a cone and is a function of the radius r. Then use the inverse function to calculate the radius of such a mound of gravel measuring 100 cubic feet. Use $$p=3.14$$.", stepBody: "", answerType: "arithmetic", hints: hints, variabilization: {}}; export {step};
