        "text": "To solve this equation, you can use the subtraction property of equality by adding 45 to both sides of the equation. This will give you: $$a-45+45=76+45$$ Simplifying the left side of the equation using the addition property of equality gives: $$a=121$$ Therefore, the solution to the equation is $$a=121$$.",
