        "text": "We can apply Cramer\u2019s Rule to solve a system of three equations in three variables. Cramer\u2019s Rule is straightforward, following a pattern consistent with Cramer\u2019s Rule for 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. Consider a 3x3 system of equations. $$a_1 x+b_1 y+c_1 z=d_1$$ $$a_2 x+b_2 y+c_2 z=d_2$$ $$a_3 x+b_3 y+c_3 z=d_3$$ $$x=\\frac{D_x}{D}$$, $$y=\\frac{D_y}{D}$$, $$z=\\frac{D_z}{D}$$, $$D!=0$$ If we are writing the determinant $$D_x$$, we replace the x column with the constant column. If we are writing the determinant $$D_y$$, we replace the y column with the constant column. If we are writing the determinant $$D_z$$, we replace the z column with the constant column.\\n##figure1.gif##",

        "text": "Finding the determinant of a 2\u00d72 matrix is straightforward, but finding the determinant of a 3\u00d73 matrix is more complicated. One method is to augment the 3\u00d73 matrix with a repetition of the first two columns, giving a 3\u00d75 matrix. Then we calculate the sum of the products of entries down each of the three diagonals (upper left to lower right), and subtract the products of entries up each of the three diagonals (lower left to upper right). This is more easily understood with a visual and an example. For a matrix $$A=\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\\\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\\\ a_3 & b_3 & c_3 \\end{bmatrix}$$, 1. Augment A with the first 2 columns, det(A)=|(a_1,b_1,c_1),(a_2,b_2,c_2),(a_3,b_3,c_3)|(a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),(a_3,b_3)| 2. From upper left to lower right: Multiply the entries down the first diagonal. Add the result to the product of entries down the second diagonal. Add this result to the product of the entries down the third diagonal. 3. From lower left to upper right: Subtract the product of entries up the first diagonal. From this result subtract the product of entries up the second diagonal. From this result, subtract the product of entries up the third diagonal. The algebra is as follows: $$|A|=a_1 b_2 c_3+b_1 c_2 a_3+c_1 a_2 b_3-a_3 b_2 c_1-b_3 c_2 a_1-c_3 a_2 b_1$$\\n##figure2.gif##",
