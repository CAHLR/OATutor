    "body": "Suppose that a recent article stated that the mean time spent in jail by a first-time convicted burglar is $$2.5$$ years. A study was then done to see if the mean time has increased in the new century. A random sample of $$26$$ first-time convicted burglars in a recent year was picked. The mean length of time in jail from the survey was three years with a standard deviation of $$1.8$$ years. Suppose that it is somehow known that the population standard deviation is $$1.5$$. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean length of jail time has increased. Assume the distribution of the jail times is approximately normal.",
