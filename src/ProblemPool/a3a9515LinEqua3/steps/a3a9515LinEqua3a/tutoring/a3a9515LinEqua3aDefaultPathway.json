        "text": "The slope-intercept form of a line is given by: $$y=mx+b$$ Where m is the slope of the line and $$b$$ is the $$y-intercept$$, which is the point where the line crosses the $$y-axis$$. In this case, the slope of the line is given as -3 and the point through which the line passes is (4,8). We can use these two pieces of information to write the equation of the line. Substituting the values into the slope-intercept form, we get: $$y=-3x+b$$ To find the value of $$b$$, we can substitute the coordinates of the point (4,8) into the equation and solve for b: $$8=-3\\left(4\\right)+b$$ $$8=-12+b$$ $$20=b$$ So the $$y-intercept$$ of the line is (0,20). Therefore, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is: $$y=-3x+20$$ This is the final equation.",
