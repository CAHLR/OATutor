        "text": "To solve this equation, you can use the subtraction property of equality by adding $$45$$ to both sides of the equation. This will give you:\\n$$a-45+45=76+45$$\\nSimplifying the left side of the equation using the addition property of equality gives:\\n$$a=121$$\\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $$a=121$$.",
