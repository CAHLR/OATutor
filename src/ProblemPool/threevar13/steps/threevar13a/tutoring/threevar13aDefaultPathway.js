First, we assign a variable to each of the three investment amounts: $$x=money_{market}$$ fund, $$y=municipal$$ bonds, $$z=mutual$$ funds. With these variables, we can create the three following equations based on the information given in the word problem: x+y+z=12000,z=y+4000,0.03x+0.04y+0.07z=670. These three equations make a system. To make the caculations easier, the last equation can be multipled by 100, giving us $$\\left(3\\right) x+\\left(4\\right) y+\\left(7\\right) z=67000$$", variabilization: {}}, {id: "threevar13a-h2", type: "hint", dependencies: ["threevar13a-h1"], title: "Solving for x, y, and z", text: "To solve this equation, we must first multiply equation 1 by -3, giving us $$y+\\left(4\\right) z=31000$$. We can now add equation 2 to that derived in the eprevious step to give us $$5z=35000$$, $$z=7000$$. With z, we can solve for y: we plug back in to equation 2 and solve for y. $$-y+\\left(7000\\right)=4000, y=3000$$. Finally, we plug z and y into equation 1 to get $$x+\\left(3000\\right)+\\left(7000\\right)=12000$$, leading to $$x=2000$$.
