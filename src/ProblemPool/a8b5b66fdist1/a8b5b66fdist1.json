    "body": "As part of an experiment to see how different types of soil cover would affect slicing tomato production, Marist College students grew tomato plants under different soil cover conditions. Groups of three plants each had one of the following treatments: bare soil, a commercial ground cover, black plastic, straw, or compost. All plants grew under the same conditions and were the same variety. Students recorded the weight (in grams) of tomatoes produced by each of the n $$=$$ 15 plants in Table 13.4. The means of the tomato yields under the five mulching conditions are represented by \u03bc1, \u03bc2, \u03bc3, \u03bc4, \u03bc5.\\n##figure4.gif",
