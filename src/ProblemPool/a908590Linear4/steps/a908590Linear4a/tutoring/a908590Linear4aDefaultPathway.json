        "text": "To solve this equation, we need to get all the terms with q on one side of the equation and all the constants on the other side. First, we can start by simplifying the left side of the equation: $$8\\left(q+1\\right)-5=8q+8-5$$ $$=8q+3$$ Now let's simplify the right side of the equation: $$3(2q-4)-1=6q-12-1$$ $$=6q-13$$ Now we have: $$8q+3=6q-13$$ Next, we can get rid of the q terms by subtracting 6q from both sides: $$8q-6q+3=6q-6q-13$$ $$2q+3=-13$$ Finally, we can get rid of the constant term by subtracting 3 from both sides: $$2q+3$$ - $$3=-13-3$$ $$2q=-16$$ Dividing both sides by 2, we get: $$q=-8$$ Therefore, the solution to the equation is $$q=-8$$.",
