        "text": "To solve this equation, we need to get all the terms with q on one side of the equation and all the constants on the other side.\\nFirst, we can start by simplifying the left side of the equation:\\n$$8\\left(q+1\\right)-5=8q+8-5$$\\n$$=8q+3$$\\nNow let's simplify the right side of the equation:\\n$$3(2q-4)-1=6q-12-1$$\\n$$=6q-13$$\\nNow we have:\\n$$8q+3=6q-13$$\\nNext, we can get rid of the q terms by subtracting 6q from both sides:\\n$$8q-6q+3=6q-6q-13$$\\n$$2q+3=-13$$\\nFinally, we can get rid of the constant term by subtracting $$3$$ from both sides:\\n$$2q+3$$ - $$3=-13-3$$\\n$$2q=-16$$\\nDividing both sides by $$2$$, we get:\\n$$q=-8$$\\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $$q=-8$$.",
