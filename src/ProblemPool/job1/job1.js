One such factor is information about job opportunities for women. The idea is that if people know that educated women can get good jobs, they might take more care of the health and education of girls in their families, as an investment in the girls’ future potential as earners. Without the knowledge of job opportunities, the author hypothesizes that families do not invest in women’s well-being. The study focused on 160 villages outside the capital of India, all with little access to information about call centers and similar organizations that offer job opportunities to women. In 80 of the villages chosen at random, recruiters visited the village, described the opportunities, recruited women who had some English language proficiency and experience with computers, and provided ongoing support free of charge for three years. In the other 80 villages, no recruiters visited and no other intervention was made. At the end of the study period, the researchers recorded data about the school attendance and health of the children in the villages.", steps: steps, variabilization: {}}; export { problem };
