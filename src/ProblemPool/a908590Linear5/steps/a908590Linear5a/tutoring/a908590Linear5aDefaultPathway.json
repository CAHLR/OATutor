        "text": "To solve this equation, we need to get all of the terms with $$p$$ on one side and all of the constants on the other side. First, let's start $$by$$ combining like terms on each side: $$6(p-3)-7=5\\left(4p+3\\right)-12$$ $$6p-18-7=20p+15-12$$ Next, let's move all of the $$p$$ terms to the left side and all of the constants to the right side: $$6p-7-18=20p-12+15$$ Finally, let's combine the like terms: $$6p-25=20p+3$$ Now we can solve for $$p$$ $$by$$ subtracting $$6p$$ from both sides and adding 25 to both sides: $$-14p=28$$ To solve for $$p$$, we divide both sides $$by$$ -14: $$p=-2$$ Therefore, the solution to the equation is $$p=-2$$.",
