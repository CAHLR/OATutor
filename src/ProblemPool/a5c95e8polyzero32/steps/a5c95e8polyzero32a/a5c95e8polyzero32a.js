(Consider that there are complex roots as well, provide the answer as a list of coordinates of the form: (number of positive real zeros, number of negative real zeros, number of complex zeros). Sort the list in descending order, i.e. compare the first coordinate and place whichever has a higher value earlier in the list. If there is a tie, look at the second, then third coordinate.
