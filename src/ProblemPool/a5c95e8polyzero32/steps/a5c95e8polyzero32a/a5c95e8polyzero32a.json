(Consider that there are complex roots as well, provide the answer as a list of coordinates of the form: (number of positive real zeros, number of negative real zeros, number of complex zeros). Sort the list in descending order, i.e. compare the first coordinate and place whichever has a higher value earlier in the list. If there is a tie, look at the second, then third coordinate. Example: (4, $$0$$, 0), (2, $$2$$, 0), (0, 4,0), (0, $$2$$, 2) )",
