The number of books is discrete data, since books are counted. \\\\n 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1; 1 \\\\n 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2; 2 \\\\n 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3; 3 \\\\n 4; 4; 4; 4; 4; 4 \\\\n 5; 5; 5; 5; 5 \\\\n 6; 6 \\\\n Eleven students buy one book. Ten students buy two books. Sixteen students buy three books. Six students buy four books. Five students buy five books. Two students buy six books. \\\\n Because the data are integers, subtract 0.5 from 1, the smallest data value and add 0.5 to 6, the largest data value. Then the starting point is 0.5 and the ending value is 6.5.",
