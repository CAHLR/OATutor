What is x? We can multiply both sides by 7.75 which gets $$x=\\frac{6.5\\times7.75}{8}$$. We can simplify the fraction by multiplying 1000 both numerator and denominator which gives $$\\frac{50375}{8000}$$. The greatest common factor of 50375 and 8000 is 125. We can divide 125 both numerator and denominator which get $$\\frac{\\frac{50375}{125}}{\\frac{8000}{125}}=\\frac{403}{64}$$. Therefore, Tom is $$\\frac{403}{64}$$ feet.", variabilization: {}}, ]; export {hints};
