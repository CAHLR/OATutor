We can simplify the fraction by multiplying $$1000$$ both numerator and denominator which gives $$\\frac{50375}{8000}$$. The greatest common factor of $$50375$$ and $$8000$$ is $$125$$. We can divide $$125$$ both numerator and denominator which get $$\\frac{\\frac{50375}{125}}{\\frac{8000}{125}}=\\frac{403}{64}$$. Therefore, Tom is $$\\frac{403}{64}$$ feet.",
