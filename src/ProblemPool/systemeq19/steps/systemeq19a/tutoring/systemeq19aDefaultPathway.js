Additionally, since we know the 90 pounds cost $1.40 per pound, the total cost is $$90\\times1.4=126$$. Knowing this total cost, we can get our second equation: $$1.8a+1.2b=126$$.", variabilization: {}}, {id: "systemeq19a-h2", type: "hint", dependencies: ["systemeq19a-h1"], title: "How to Use the Systems of Equations", text: "Solve the two equations as a normal system of equations to find the values of the two variables.", variabilization: {}}, ]; export {hints};
