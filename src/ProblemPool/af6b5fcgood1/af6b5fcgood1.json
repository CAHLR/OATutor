    "body": "Absenteeism of college students from math classes is a major concern to math instructors because missing class appears to increase the drop rate. Suppose that a study was done to determine if the actual student absenteeism rate follows faculty perception. The faculty expected that a group of 100 students would miss class according to Table 1. A random survey across all mathematics courses was then done to determine the actual number (observed) of absences in a course. The chart in Table 2 displays the results of that survey.\\n##figure4.gif",
