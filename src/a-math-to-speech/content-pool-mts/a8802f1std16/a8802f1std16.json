    "body": "A professor at a large community college wanted to determine whether there is a difference in the means of final exam scores between students who took his statistics course online and the students who took his face-to-face statistics class. He believed that the mean of the final exam scores for the online class would be lower than that of the face-to-face class. The randomly selected $$30$$ final exam scores from each group are listed in Table $$10.3$$ and Table $$10.4$$.",
