By definition, a continuous probability density function (PDF), denoted as f(x), must satisfy two properties:\\n(i) f(x) $$ \\geq $$ $$0$$ for all $$x$$ in the domain.\\n(ii) The total area under f(x), over the entire real line (or the relevant domain), is $$1$$.\\n\\n$$2$$. Mathematically, property (ii) is expressed as:\\n\u222b f(x) dx $$=$$ $$1$$,\\nwhere the integration is taken over the entire domain of $$x$$.\\n\\n$$3$$. This integral result signifies that the total probability associated with the distribution is exactly $$1$$, a fundamental requirement for probability distributions.\\n\\nAnswer: $$1$$",
