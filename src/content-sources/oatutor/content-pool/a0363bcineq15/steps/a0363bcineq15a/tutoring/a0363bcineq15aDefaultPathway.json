For example, the expression $$\"x \\leq -1\"$$ includes all numbers less than or equal to $$-1$$. Since $$-1$$ is included in the solution, the interval notation is $$(-\\infty,-1]$$. Since $$\\infty$$ represents \"infinity\" and is not an actual number, we always put a parenthesis next to $$\\infty$$.",
