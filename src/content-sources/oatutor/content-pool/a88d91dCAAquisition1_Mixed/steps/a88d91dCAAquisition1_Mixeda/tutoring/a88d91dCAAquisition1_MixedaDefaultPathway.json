        "text": "To find the equation of the line passing through two points, we need to first find the slope, which is given by:\\n\\n$$m$$ $$=$$ (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)\\n\\nwhere (x1, y1) $$=$$ $$(3,4)$$ and (x2, y2) $$=$$ $$(0,-3)$$\\n\\n$$m$$ $$=$$ (-3 - 4)/(0 - 3) $$=$$ $$\\frac{-7}{3}$$\\n\\nNow we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:\\n\\n$$y$$ - y1 $$=$$ m(x - x1)\\n\\nwhere (x1, y1) $$=$$ $$(3,4)$$ and $$m$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{-7}{3}$$\\n\\n$$y$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ (-7/3)(x - 3)\\n\\nFinally, we can rearrange this equation into slope-intercept form, which is:\\n\\n$$y$$ $$=$$ mx + $$b$$\\n\\nwhere $$m$$ is the slope and $$b$$ is the y-intercept\\n\\n$$y$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) x$$ + $$7$$\\n\\n$$y$$ $$=$$ $$\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) x$$ + $$11$$\\n\\nTherefore, the equation of the line passing through the points $$(3,4)$$ and $$(0,-3)$$ is $$y=\\left(-\\frac{7}{3}\\right) x+11$$.",
