There is a reflection over the x-axis (denoted by the -3), so we know that the increasing and decreasing intervals will be reversed. The base function of f(x) is $$\\sqrt{x}$$. In $$\\sqrt{x}$$ functions, the graph increases for every x-value before the vertex starting with $$0$$ and never decreases.",
