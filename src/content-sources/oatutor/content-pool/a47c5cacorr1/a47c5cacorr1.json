    "body": "A large urban school district is deciding whether to adopt a restorative justice discipline model across its middle schools. Because the initiative has never been implemented locally, the district lacks internal outcome data. During a strategic planning retreat, the Superintendent asks the Executive Director of Student Climate to estimate the likelihood that the program will reduce suspensions within two years. The director, Laura, draws upon her prior experience implementing restorative practices in two other districts, professional conference presentations, and conversations with national experts. She estimates there is a 60% probability the initiative will reduce suspension rates by at least 15%. No pilot study, randomized trial, or statistical dataset from the current district was used to calculate this estimate. Which probability estimation method is the Executive Director using to produce the 60% estimate?",
