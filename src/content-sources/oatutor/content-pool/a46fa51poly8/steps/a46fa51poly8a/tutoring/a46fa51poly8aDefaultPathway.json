        "text": "$$1$$. Start with the given equation:\\n3x\u00b2 $$=$$ $$12x$$ + $$63$$\\n\\n$$2$$. Bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\\n3x\u00b2 - $$12x$$ - $$63$$ $$=$$ $$0$$\\n\\n$$3$$. Factor out the common factor 3:\\n3(x\u00b2 - $$4x$$ - 21) $$=$$ $$0$$\\n\\n$$4$$. Divide both sides by 3:\\nx\u00b2 - $$4x$$ - $$21$$ $$=$$ $$0$$\\n\\n$$5$$. Factor the quadratic expression:\\nThe product of the two numbers must be $$-21$$, and their sum must be $$-4$$.\\n...",
