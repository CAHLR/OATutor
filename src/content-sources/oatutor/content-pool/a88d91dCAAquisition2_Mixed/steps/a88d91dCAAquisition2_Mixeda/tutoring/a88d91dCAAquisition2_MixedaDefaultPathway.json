        "text": "To find the equation of a line with slope $$m$$ and passing through a point (x1, y1), we use the point-slope form:\\n\\n$$y$$ - y1 $$=$$ m(x - x1)\\n\\nIn this problem, $$m$$ $$=$$ $$-6$$ and the point (x1, y1) $$=$$ (1/4, -2). Substituting these values into the point-slope form, we get:\\n\\n$$y$$ - $$(-2)$$ $$=$$ -6(x - 1/4)\\n\\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\\n\\n$$y$$ + $$2$$ $$=$$ $$-6x$$ + $$\\frac{3}{2}$$\\n\\nSubtracting $$2$$ from both sides, we get:\\n\\n$$y$$ $$=$$ $$-6x$$ - $$\\frac{1}{2}$$\\n\\nTo write the equation in standard form (Ax + By $$=$$ C), we need to move all the variables to one side of the equation:\\n\\n$$6x$$ + $$y$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{-1}{2}$$\\n\\nMultiplying both sides by $$-2$$ to get rid of the fraction, we get:\\n\\n$$-12x$$ - $$2y$$ $$=$$ $$1$$\\n\\nSo the equation of the line with slope $$m$$ $$=$$ $$-6$$ and passing through the point (1/4, -2) is:\\n\\n$$-12x$$ - $$2y$$ $$=$$ $$1$$.",
