        "text": "The first to observe 'animalcules' under the microscope was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch scientist who is credited with being the first microbiologist. In the late 1670s, he used a microscope of his own design to observe microorganisms in pond water, and he called them \"animalcules.\" Leeuwenhoek's discoveries established the science of microbiology and opened the door to the study of microorganisms and their impact on human health and the environment.",
