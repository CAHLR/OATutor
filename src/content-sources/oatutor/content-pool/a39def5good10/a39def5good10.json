The results of students' expected majors by gender were reported in The Chronicle of Higher Education $$\\frac{\\frac{2}{2}}{2006}$$. Suppose a survey of 5,000 graduating females and 5,000 graduating males was done as a follow-up last year to determine what their actual majors were. The results are shown in the tables for Exercise $$11.77$$ and Exercise $$11.78$$. The second column in each table does not add to 100% because of rounding.",
