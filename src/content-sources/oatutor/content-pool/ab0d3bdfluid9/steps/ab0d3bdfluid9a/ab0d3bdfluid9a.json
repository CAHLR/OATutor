Typical air density in Boulder is $$1.14$$ $$\\frac{kg}{m^3}$$, and the corresponding atmospheric pressure is $$8.89\\times {10}^4$$ $$\\frac{N}{m^2}$$. (Bernoulli\u2019s principle as stated in the text assumes laminar flow. Using the principle here produces only an approximate result, because there is significant turbulence.)",
