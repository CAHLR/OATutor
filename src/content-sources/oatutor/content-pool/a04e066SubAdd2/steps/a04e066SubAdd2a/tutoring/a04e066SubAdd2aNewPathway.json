        "text": "To solve the equation $$b-0.47=-2.1$$, we need to isolate the variable $$b$$ on one side of the equation.\\nTo do this, we can add $$0.47$$ to both sides of the equation to get:\\n$$b-0.47+0.47=-2.1+0.47$$\\nCombining like terms on the left side of the equation gives:\\n$$b=-1.63$$\\nSo the solution to the equation is $$b=-1.63$$.",
