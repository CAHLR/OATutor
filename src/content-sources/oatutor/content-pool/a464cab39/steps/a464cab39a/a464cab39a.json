    "stepBody": "In $$1967$$, New Zealander Burt Munro set the world record for an Indian motorcycle, on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, with a maximum speed of $$183.58$$ $$\\frac{mi}{h}$$. the one-way course was $$5.00$$ mi long. Acceleration rates are often described by the time it takes to reach $$60.0$$ $$\\frac{mi}{h}$$ from rest. If this time was $$4.00$$ s, and Burt accelerated at this rate until he reached his maximum speed, how long did it take Burt to complete the course?",
