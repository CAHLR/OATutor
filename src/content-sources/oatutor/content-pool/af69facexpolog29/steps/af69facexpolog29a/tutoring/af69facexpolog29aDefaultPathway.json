In the model, M is the magnitude of the earthquake, $$S_0$$ is the initial seismic moment that led to the occurence of earthquake. S is the seismic moment associated with an earthquake. If we denote the seismic moment of the first earthquake as $$S_1$$. In the context of the question, since the second earthquake has $$750$$ times as much energy as the first, we can interpret its seismic moment as $$750S_1$$.",
