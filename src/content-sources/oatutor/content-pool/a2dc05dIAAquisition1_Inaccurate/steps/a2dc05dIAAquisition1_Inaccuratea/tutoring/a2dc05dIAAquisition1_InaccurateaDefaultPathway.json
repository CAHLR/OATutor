        "text": "We can determine whether the value is a solution to the equation by substituting $$y=\\frac{3}{5}$$ into the equation and seeing if the equation is true:\\n\\n$$5\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$$ + $$3$$ $$=$$ $$\\operatorname{10}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$$ - $$4$$\\n\\n$$3$$ + $$3$$ $$=$$ $$6$$ - $$4$$\\n\\n$$6$$ $$=$$ $$6$$\\n\\nSince both sides are equal, the equation is true. Therefore, $$y=\\frac{3}{5}$$ is a solution to the equation.",
