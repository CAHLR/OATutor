    "body": "Two college instructors are interested in whether or not there is any variation in the way they grade math exams. They each grade the same set of $$30$$ exams. The first instructor's grades have a variance of $$52.3$$. The second instructor's grades have a variance of $$89.9$$. Test the claim that the first instructor's variance is smaller. (In most colleges, it is desirable for the variances of exam grades to be nearly the same among instructors.) The level of significance is 10%.",
