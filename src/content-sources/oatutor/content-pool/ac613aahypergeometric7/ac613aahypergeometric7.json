    "body": "You are president of an on-campus special events organization. You need a committee of seven students to plan a special birthday party for the president of the college. Your organization consists of $$18$$ women and $$15$$ men. You are interested in the number of men on your committee, particularly, the probability that the committee has more than four men. This is a hypergeometric problem because you are choosing your committee from two groups (men and women).",
