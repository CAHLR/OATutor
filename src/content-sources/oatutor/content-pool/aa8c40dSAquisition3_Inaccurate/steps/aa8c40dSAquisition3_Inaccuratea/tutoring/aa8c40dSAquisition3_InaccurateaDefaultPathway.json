        "text": "No, events A and B are not independent.\\n\\nTo show this, we can use the formula for the probability of the intersection of two events:\\n\\nP(A AND B) $$=$$ P(A) * P(B | A)\\n\\nwhere P(B | A) is the conditional probability of event B given that event A has occurred.\\n\\nIf events A and B were independent, then we would have:\\n\\nP(B | A) $$=$$ P(B)\\n\\nHowever, in this case, we have:\\n\\nP(B | A) $$=$$ P(A AND B) / P(A) $$=$$ $$0.02$$ / $$0.1$$ $$=$$ $$0.2$$\\n\\nwhich is not equal to P(B) $$=$$ $$0.2$$.\\n\\nTherefore, events A and B are dependent.
