        "text": "The slope-intercept form of a line is given by:\\n$$y=mx+b$$\\nWhere $$m$$ is the slope of the line and $$b$$ is the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\\nIn this case, the slope of the line is given as $$-3$$ and the point through which the line passes is $$(4,8)$$. We can use these two pieces of information to write the equation of the line.\\nSubstituting the values into the slope-intercept form, we get:\\n$$y=-3x+b$$\\nTo find the value of $$b$$, we can substitute the coordinates of the point $$(4,8)$$ into the equation and solve for b:\\n$$8=-3\\left(4\\right)+b$$\\n$$8=-12+b$$\\n$$20=b$$\\nSo the y-intercept of the line is $$(0,20)$$.\\nTherefore, the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is:\\n$$y=-3x+20$$\\nThis is the final equation.",
