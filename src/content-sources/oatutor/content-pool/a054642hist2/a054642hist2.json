Ten students buy two books. Sixteen students buy three books. Six students buy four books. Five students buy five books. Two students buy six books.\\nBecause the data are integers, subtract $$0.5$$ from $$1$$, the smallest data value and add $$0.5$$ to $$6$$, the largest data value. Then the starting point is $$0.5$$ and the ending value is $$6.5$$.",
