        "text": "This theory follows a macroscopic description of chemical behavior. Macroscopic refers to observations and measurements that can be done without the need of a microscope or any other specialized equipment. The amount of heat required to melt $$1$$ lb or $$2$$ lbs of ice can be observed and measured without any specialized equipment. Therefore, this observation is macroscopic. Microscopic, on the other hand, refers to the behavior or properties of individual atoms, molecules, or particles. This observation does not describe the behavior of individual atoms or molecules but, rather, the behavior of the substance as a whole.",
