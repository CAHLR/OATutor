        "text": "Firstly, we can distribute the $$\\frac{2}{3}$$ on the left side of the equation:\\n\\n(2/3)(3\ud835\udc5a-6) $$=$$ $$\\frac{2}{3}$$ * 3\ud835\udc5a - $$\\frac{2}{3}$$ * $$6$$\\n2\ud835\udc5a - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$5$$ - \ud835\udc5a\\n\\nNext, we can combine like terms on both sides:\\n\\n3\ud835\udc5a + \ud835\udc5a $$=$$ $$5$$ + $$4$$\\n4\ud835\udc5a $$=$$ $$9$$\\n\\nFinally, we can solve for \ud835\udc5a by dividing both sides by 4:\\n\\n\ud835\udc5a $$=$$ $$\\frac{9}{4}$$\\n\\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is \ud835\udc5a $$=$$ $$\\frac{9}{4}$$.",
