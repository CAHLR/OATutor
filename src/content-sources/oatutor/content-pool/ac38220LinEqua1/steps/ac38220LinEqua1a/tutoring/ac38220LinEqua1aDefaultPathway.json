        "text": "To find the slope of a line that passes through the points $$(-2,6)$$ and $$(1,4)$$, we can use the slope formula:\\n$$slope=\\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$$\\nPlugging in the coordinates of the two points, we get:\\n$$slope=\\frac{4-6}{1-\\left(-2\\right)}=\\frac{-2}{3}=-0.66667$$\\nSo the slope of the line that passes through the points $$(-2,6)$$ and $$(1,4)$$ is $$-0.66667$$.",
