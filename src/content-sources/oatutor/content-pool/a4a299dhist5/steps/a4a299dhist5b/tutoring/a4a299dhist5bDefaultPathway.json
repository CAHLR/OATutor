        "text": "The smallest data value is $$60$$. Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal (for instance, $$61.5)$$, we want our starting point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers $$0.5$$, $$0.05$$, $$0.005$$, etc. are convenient numbers, use $$0.05$$ and subtract it from $$60$$, the smallest value, for the convenient starting point.\\n$$60-0.05$$ $$=$$ $$59.95$$ which is more precise than, say, $$61.5$$ by one decimal place. The starting point is, then, $$59.95$$.",
