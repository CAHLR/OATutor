        "text": "Note that the high school counselor uses a computer to generate $$50$$ random numbers. We see that this is a methodology that is not based on convenience (the high school counselor doesn't just pick the most easily available data points). Therefore, it must either be systematic or simple random from process of elimination. The definition of a systematic sample is randomly selecting a starting point and take the nth piece of data from the population. The definition of simple random sampling is fairly selecting a group of size $$n$$ from the population so every individual has the same chance of being selected. We see that the high school counselor assigns students randomly to numbers and fairly randomly generated $$50$$ which each student having an equal chance. Which of the two methods sounds the most like the high school counselor's selection method?",
