The definition of a systematic sampling is one where you randomly select a strating point and take the nth piece of data from the population. The definition of simple random sampling is fairly selecting a group of size $$n$$ from the population so every individual has the same chance of being selected. Which one sounds the most like the woman's selection method?",
