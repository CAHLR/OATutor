    "stepTitle": "Consider a thermodynamic cycle where a system undergoes a series of spontaneous (irreversible) and reversible processes, ultimately returning to its original state. Predict the overall change in enthalpy (\u0394H) for the system at the end of the cycle. What can be inferred about the change in enthalpy based on the fact that the system returns to its initial state?",
