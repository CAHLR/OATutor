The length of the rectangle is 2a and its width is $$2b$$. The slopes of the diagonals are $$\\frac{b}{a}$$ and $$\\frac{-b}{a}$$, and each diagonal passes through the center (h,k). Using the point-slope formula, it is simple to show that the equations of the asymptotes are $$y=\\frac{b}{a} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$ and $$y=\\frac{-b}{a} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$.\\n(See the left image)\\n\\nThe standard form of the equation of a hyperbola with center (h,k) and transverse axis parallel to the y-axis is\\n$$\\frac{\\left(y-k\\right)^2}{a^2}-\\frac{\\left(x-h\\right)^2}{b^2}=1$$\\nwhere\\nthe length of the transverse axis is 2a\\nthe coordinates of the vertices are (h,k+a),(h,k-a)\\nthe length of the conjugate axis is $$2b$$\\nthe coordinates of the co-vertices are (h+b,k),(h-b,k)\\nthe distance between the foci is 2c, where $$c^2=a^2+b^2$$\\nthe coordinates of the foci are (h,k+c),(h,k-c)\\nUsing the reasoning above, the equations of the asymptotes are $$y=\\frac{a}{b} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$ and $$y=\\frac{-a}{b} \\left(x-h\\right)+k$$.\\n##figure1.gif##",
