    "body": "Two cyclists are comparing the variances of their overall paces going uphill. Each cyclist records his or her speeds going up $$35$$ hills. The first cyclist has a variance of $$23.8$$ and the second cyclist has a variance of $$32.1$$. The cyclists want to see if their variances are the same or different. Assume that commute times are normally distributed.",
