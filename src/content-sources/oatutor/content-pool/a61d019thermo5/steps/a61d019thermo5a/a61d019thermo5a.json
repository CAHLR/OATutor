    "stepTitle": "Suppose an ice cube weighing $$36.0$$ g at a temperature of -10\u00b0C is placed in $$360$$ g water at a temperature of 20\u00b0C. Calculate the temperature after thermal equilibrium is reached, assuming no heat loss to the surroundings. The enthalpy of fusion of ice is $$\\Delta H_{fus}$$ $$=$$ $$6.007$$ kJ $${mol}^{-1}$$, and the molar heat capacities $$c_P$$ of ice and water are $$38$$ and $$75$$ J \u00b0C**-1 $${mol}^{-1}$$, respectively.",
