        "text": "The slope-intercept form of a line is given by:\\n$$y=mx+b$$\\nwhere $$m$$ is the slope of the line and $$b$$ is the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\\nGiven that $$m=4$$ and the point $$(2,5)$$ lies on the line, we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for b:\\n$$5=4\\times2+b$$\\nSolving this equation gives us $$b=-3$$, so the equation of the line in slope-intercept form is:\\n$$y=4x-3$$\\nThis means that for any value of $$x$$, we can find the corresponding value of $$y$$ by plugging $$x$$ into the equation. For example, if $$x=1$$, then $$y$$ $$=$$ $$4\\times1-3=1$$.",
