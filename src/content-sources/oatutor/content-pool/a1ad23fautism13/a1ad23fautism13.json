    "body": "Jaquese is a ten-year-old student in an inclusive fourth- grade classroom. Jaquese loves mathematics and science and is above grade level in both subjects. Because of this, his teachers have a hard time keeping him engaged during mathematics and science instruction. On the other hand, Jaquese has difficulty with reading and writing. He also struggles with reading comprehension, both when a story is read to him and when he reads it independently. He\u2019s obsessed with superheroes and will often quote and act out scenes from their comic books or films. This is often frustrating for the teacher, because no matter how she tries to distract him from his imaginary superheroes, he always comes back to them. In fact, he often cannot begin his work until he has finished acting out an entire scene. Further, most students do not understand his obsession; they find Jaquese annoying and do their best to avoid him. Select the correct answer.",
