The domain of the relation is the set of all first elements $$(x-values)$$, which is {1, $$2$$, $$3$$, $$4$$, 5}.\\n$$3$$. The range of the relation is the set of all second elements $$(y-values)$$, which is {3, $$6$$, $$9$$, $$12$$, 15}.\\n$$4$$. To find the highest range value (i.e., the maximum of the y-values), we look at the values in the range and see that $$15$$ is the largest.\\n...",
