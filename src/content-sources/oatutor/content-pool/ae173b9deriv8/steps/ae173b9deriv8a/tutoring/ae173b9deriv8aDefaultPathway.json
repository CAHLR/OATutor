        "text": "Now that we know that the time intervals in which the particle is moving left to right is $$0$$ to $$2$$ and $$4$$ to $$+\\infty$$, we must now construct this into a cohesive range statement. Square brackets mean that the end point is included, and round parentheses mean that it is excluded. Infinity symbols are always accompanied by round (exclusive) brackets, and U is used to combine intervals. Thus, the time interval is [0,2) U (4,+\u221e).",
