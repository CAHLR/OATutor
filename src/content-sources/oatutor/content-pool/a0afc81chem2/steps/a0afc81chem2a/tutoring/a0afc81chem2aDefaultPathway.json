        "text": "The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. This means that as the wavelength decreases, the energy of the photon increases. This relationship is described by the equation: $$E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$$, where E is the energy, $$h$$ is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength.",
