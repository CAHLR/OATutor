The formula for relating frequency and wavelength is $$\ud835\udc50=\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf08$$ where c is the speed of light (2.998\u00d710**8 m/s) \ud835\udf06 is the wavelength, and \ud835\udf08 is the frequency. $$1nm=$$ $$1{X10}^{-9} m$$. (Please refer to the electromagnetic radiation diagram posted in lecture slides for wavelength and color correlation)",
