    "stepTitle": "Suppose a block of ice weighing $$50.0$$ g at a temperature of -5\u00b0C is placed in $$500$$ g of water at a temperature of 25\u00b0C. Calculate the final temperature after thermal equilibrium is reached, assuming no heat loss to the surroundings. The enthalpy of fusion of ice is $$\\Delta H_{fus}$$ $$=$$ $$6.007$$ kJ $${mol}^{-1}$$, and the molar heat capacities c_P\u200b of ice and water are $$36$$ J \u00b0C**-1 $${mol}^{-1}$$ and $$75$$ J \u00b0C**-1, respectively.",
