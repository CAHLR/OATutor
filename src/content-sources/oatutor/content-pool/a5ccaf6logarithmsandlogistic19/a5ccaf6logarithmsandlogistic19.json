    "body": "In $$2007$$, a university study was published investigating the crash risk of alcohol impaired driving. Data from 2,871 crashes were used to measure the association of a person\u2019s blood alcohol level (BAC) with the risk of being in an accident. The attached table shows results from the study. The relative risk is a measure of how many times more likely a person is to crash. So, for example, a person with a BAC of $$0.09$$ is $$3.54$$ times as likely to crash as a person who has not been drinking alcohol.\\n##figure2.gif",
