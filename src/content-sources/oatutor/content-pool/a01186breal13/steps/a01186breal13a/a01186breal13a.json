    "stepTitle": "Gasoline consumption in the United States has been steadily increasing. Consumption data from $$1994$$ to $$2004$$ is shown in these datapoints. The $$x$$ coordinate represents the year and the $$y$$ coordinate represents the consumption in billions of gallons. These are the coordinates for . $$(94,113)$$, $$(95,116)$$, $$(96,118)$$, $$(97,119)$$, $$(98,123)$$, $$(99,125)$$, $$(00,126)$$, $$(01,128)$$, $$(02,131)$$, $$(03,133)$$, $$(04,136)$$. Without solving the value, if we are trying to find the gasoline in billions of gallons in $$2008$$, will this be considered as interpolation or extrapolation?",
