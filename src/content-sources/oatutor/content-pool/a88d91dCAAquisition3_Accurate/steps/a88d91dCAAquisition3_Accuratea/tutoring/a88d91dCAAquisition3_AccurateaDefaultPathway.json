        "text": "We can start by using the point-slope form of the equation, which is:\\n\\n$$y$$ - y1 $$=$$ m(x - x1)\\n\\nwhere $$m$$ is the slope and (x1,y1) is a point on the line. We are given that the slope is $$m$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{-1}{3}$$ and the point (x1,y1) $$=$$ $$(1,\\frac{1}{3})$$, so we can substitute these values:\\n\\n$$y$$ - $$\\frac{1}{3}$$ $$=$$ (-1/3)(x - 1)\\n\\nNext, we can simplify and rearrange this equation to standard form, which is:\\n\\nAx + By $$=$$ C\\n\\nwhere A, B, and C are integers and A is positive. To do this, we can distribute the $$\\frac{-1}{3}$$ and move all the terms to one side:\\n\\n$$y$$ - $$\\frac{1}{3}$$ $$=$$ $$\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) x$$ + $$\\frac{1}{3}$$\\n$$3y$$ - $$1$$ $$=$$ $$-x$$ + $$1$$\\n$$x$$ + $$3y$$ $$=$$ $$2$$\\n\\nTherefore, the equation of the line in standard form is $$x$$ + $$3y$$ $$=$$ $$2$$.",
