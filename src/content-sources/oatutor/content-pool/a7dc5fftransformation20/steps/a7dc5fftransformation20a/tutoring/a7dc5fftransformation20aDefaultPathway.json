        "text": "Let's start with the horizontal shift. Horizontal shifts are denoted as addition (shift to the left) or subtraction (shift to the right) inside of the parentheses. Because $$x$$ is being squared in this function, we need to add the shift to $$x$$ before it is squared. To shift four units to the left, we add four to $$x$$ in the denominator, then square that value.",
