        "text": "What would we consider as a \"success\" in $$1$$ trial of this situation? By the way the situation is presented, it is fairly clear that the dolphin doing the trick should be considered a win. This is because the probability of our dolphin doing a trick was brought up before the probability of our dolphin failing. In addition, this means that a \"failure\" would be the dolphin failing the trick.",
