    "stepTitle": "Suppose a horse leans against a wall as in Figure $$9.29$$, emulating a scene in the comedy movie Cat Ballou. Calculate the force exerted on the wall (rounded to nearest $$10$$ Newtons) assuming that force is horizontal while using the data in the schematic representation of the situation. Note that the force exerted on the wall is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted on the horse, keeping it in equilibrium. the total mass of the horse and rider is $$500$$ kg. Take the data to be accurate to three digits.",
