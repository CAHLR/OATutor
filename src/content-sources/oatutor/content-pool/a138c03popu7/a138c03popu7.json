    "body": "Unoccupied seats on flights cause airlines to lose revenue. Suppose a large airline wants to estimate its mean number of unoccupied seats per flight over the past year. To accomplish this, the records of $$225$$ flights are randomly selected and the number of unoccupied seats is noted for each of the sampled flights. The sample mean is $$11.6$$ seats and the sample standard deviation is $$4.1$$ seats.",
