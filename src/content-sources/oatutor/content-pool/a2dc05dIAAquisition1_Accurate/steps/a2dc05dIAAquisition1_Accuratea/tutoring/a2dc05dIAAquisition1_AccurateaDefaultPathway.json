        "text": "To determine whether $$y=\\frac{3}{5}$$ is a solution to the equation, we substitute $$y=\\frac{3}{5}$$ into the equation and simplify:\\n\\n$$5y+3=10y-4$$\\n\\n$$5\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+3=\\operatorname{10}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)-4$$ (substituting y=3/5)\\n\\n$$3+3=6-4$$\\n\\n$$6=2$$\\n\\nThis is a false statement, since $$6$$ does not equal $$2$$. Therefore, $$y=\\frac{3}{5}$$ is not a solution to the equation.",
