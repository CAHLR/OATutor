        "text": "The slope of a line is given by the formula:\\n$$slope=\\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$$\\nPlugging in the coordinates given, we get:\\n$$slope=\\frac{3-\\left(-1\\right)}{\\left(-5-2\\right)}$$\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n$$slope=\\frac{4}{-7}$$\\nSimplifying further, we get:\\n$$slope=\\frac{-4}{7}$$\\nSo the slope of the line that passes through the points $$(2,-1)$$ and $$(-5,3)$$ is $$\\frac{-4}{7}$$.",
