        "text": "1) When you want to test a claim about a population mean (often denoted by \u03bc), you draw a sample from that population.\\n2) The natural estimator (or statistic) you use to represent the population mean from the sample is the sample mean (often denoted by x\u0304).\\n3) To conduct the hypothesis test for the population mean, you use the sample mean in constructing the test statistic (e.g., a $$z-statistic$$ or $$t-statistic$$ based on x\u0304). This is because the hypothesis is about \u03bc, and x\u0304 is the best single-sample estimate of \u03bc.\\n\\nAnswer: mean",
