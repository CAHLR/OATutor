        "text": "Step 1: check to see if f(a) is defined. If f(a) is undefined, we need go no further. The function is not continuous at a. If f(a) is defined, continue to step $$2$$. Step 2: Compute $$\\lim_{x\\toa} f(x)$$. In some cases, we may need to do this by first computing $$\\lim_{x\\toa-} f(x)$$ and /lim{x,a+,f(x)}. If $$\\lim_{x\\toa} f(x)$$ does not exist (that is, it is not a real number), then the function is not continuous at a and the problem is solved. If $$\\lim_{x\\toa} f(x)$$ exists, then continue to step $$3$$. Step 3: Compare f(a) and $$\\lim_{x\\toa} f(x)$$. If $$\\lim_{x\\toa} f(x)$$ does not equal to f(a), then the function is not continuous at a. If $$\\lim_{x\\toa} f(x)=f(a)$$, then the function is continuous at a.",
