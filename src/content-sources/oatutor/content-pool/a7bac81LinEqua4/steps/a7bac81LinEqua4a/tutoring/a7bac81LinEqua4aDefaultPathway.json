        "text": "The slope of the line represented by the equation $$y=-\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) x-4$$ is $$\\frac{-3}{4}$$.\\nTo find the slope of a line given the equation of the line, you can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is written as $$y=mx+b$$, where $$m$$ is the slope and $$b$$ is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis). In this equation, the slope is the coefficient of the $$x$$ term, which is $$\\frac{-3}{4}$$.",
