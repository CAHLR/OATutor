Because open circles indicate that the function is undefined at that particular x-value, the f(x) value when $$x$$ $$=$$ $$1$$ would be at the closed circle where f(x) $$=$$ $$6$$. If we were asked to find limits, however, there would be no difference with an open or closed circle because a limit is the value the graph is approaching from both the right and left sides.\\n##figure2.gif##",
