        "text": "To solve the equation using the subtraction and addition properties of equality, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.\\nTo do this, we can use the subtraction property of equality by subtracting $$0.52$$ from both sides of the equation:\\n$$z+0.52-0.52=-8.5-0.52$$\\n$$z=-9.02$$\\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $$z=-9.02$$.",
