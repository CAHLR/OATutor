We are told that X is approximately normally distributed with mean \u03bc $$=$$ $$0.88$$ and standard deviation \u03c3 $$=$$ $$0.10$$.\\n\\n$$2$$. We want $$P(0.80$$ < X < $$1.00)$$. To find this probability for a normal distribution, we convert each boundary to a $$z-score$$:\\n\\n$$z$$ $$=$$ (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3.\\n\\nFor $$x$$ $$=$$ $$0.80$$:\\nz\u2081 $$=$$ $$(0.80$$ - $$0.88)$$ / $$0.10$$ $$=$$ $$-0.08$$ / $$0.10$$ $$=$$ $$-0.8$$.\\n\\nFor $$x$$ $$=$$ $$1.00$$:\\nz\u2082 $$=$$ $$(1.00$$ - $$0.88)$$ / $$0.10$$ $$=$$ $$0.12$$ / $$0.10$$ $$=$$ $$1.2$$.\\n\\n$$3$$.
