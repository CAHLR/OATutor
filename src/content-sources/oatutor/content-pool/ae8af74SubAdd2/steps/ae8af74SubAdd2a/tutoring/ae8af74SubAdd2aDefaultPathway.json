        "text": "To solve this equation using the subtraction and addition properties of equality, we can subtract $$\\frac{1}{4}$$ from both sides of the equation. This gives us:\\n$$b=\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{1}{4}$$\\n$$=\\frac{3-1}{4}$$\\n$$=\\frac{2}{4}$$\\n$$=\\frac{1}{2}$$\\nSo the solution to the equation is $$b=\\frac{1}{2}$$.",
