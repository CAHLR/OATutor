    "stepTitle": "A college football coach records the mean weight that his players can bench press as $$275$$ pounds, with a standard deviation of $$55$$ pounds. Three of his players thought that the mean weight was more than that amount. They asked $$30$$ of their teammates for their estimated maximum lift on the bench press exercise. The data ranged from $$205$$ pounds to $$385$$ pounds. The actual different weights were (frequencies are in parentheses) 205(3); 215(3); 225(1); 241(2); 252(2); 265(2); 275(2); 313(2); 316(5); 338(2); 341(1); 345(2); 368(2); 385(1). Conduct a hypothesis test using a $$2.5\\%$$ level of significance to determine if the bench press mean is more than $$275$$ pounds.",
