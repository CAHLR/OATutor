    "stepTitle": "Consider a gas contained in a piston-cylinder device. The gas undergoes a series of processes, starting from state A, which includes:\\n\\n$$1$$. An isothermal expansion where it absorbs heat from the surroundings.\\n$$2$$. A spontaneous adiabatic expansion to a larger volume.\\n$$3$$. A reversible isothermal compression to a volume smaller than the initial state.\\n$$4$$. Finally, a heat exchange with the surroundings that brings the gas back to its initial state A.\\n\\nQualitatively describe the net change in enthalpy (\u0394H) of the gas after it undergoes these processes and is returned to state A.",
