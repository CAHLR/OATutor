Recall the formula for the $$n-th$$ term (a\u2099) in a geometric sequence:\\na\u2099 $$=$$ a\u2081 \u00d7 $$r^{n-1}$$,\\nwhere a\u2081 is the first term and $$r$$ is the common ratio.\\n\\n$$2$$. Here, the first term a\u2081 $$=$$ $$16$$ and the common ratio $$r$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{-1}{3}$$. We need the fourth term, which corresponds to $$n$$ $$=$$ $$4$$.\\n\\n$$3$$. Substitute into the formula:\\na\u2084 $$=$$ $$16$$ \u00d7 $${\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)}^{4-1}$$\\n...",
