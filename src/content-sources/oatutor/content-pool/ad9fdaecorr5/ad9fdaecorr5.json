For training purposes, she creates a simplified simulation in which buses can arrive \u201cEarly,\u201d \u201cOn Time,\u201d or \u201cLate.\u201d She assumes each outcome has an equal theoretical likelihood for demonstration purposes. She asks trainees to calculate the probability that a bus arrives on time based solely on these three equally likely outcomes.",
