        "title": "The proportion above the bar represents the proportion of people (out of $$111$$ people) who own the corresponding number of T-shirts costing more than $19 each. For instance, $$\\frac{5}{111}$$ above the first bar represents there are $$5$$ people (out of $$111$$ people) own exactly one T-shirt costing more than $19. At most $$3$$ T-shirt means $$1$$ T-shirt, $$2$$ T-shirt, or $$3$$ T-shirt. Therefore, we should look at the sum of proportion of the first three bars which are $$\\frac{5}{111}$$, $$\\frac{17}{111}$$ and $$\\frac{23}{111}$$. The sum of numerator of these three fraction tells us how many people own at most $$3$$ T-shirts costing more than $19 each. What is the sum of numerator for the fractions $$\\frac{5}{111}$$, $$\\frac{17}{111}$$ and $$\\frac{23}{111}$$?",
