        "text": "There are a few different forms of the equation of a line, and one common standard form is:\\n\\nAx + By $$=$$ C\\n\\nwhere A, B, and C are constants (potentially including negative values), and $$x$$ and $$y$$ are the variables. This form has the benefit of having integer coefficients, which can be helpful in some contexts.\\n\\nTo use this form, we need to find values for A, B, and C that satisfy the conditions given. We know that the line has a slope of $$\\frac{-1}{3}$$, which means that for any two points on the line (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we have:\\n\\n(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) $$=$$ $$\\frac{-1}{3}$$\\n\\nWe also know that the line passes through the point (1, 1/3), which means that this point satisfies the equation:\\n\\nA(1) + $$B\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$ $$=$$ C\\n\\nWe can simplify this equation to:\\n\\nA + $$\\frac{1}{3} B$$ $$=$$ C - $$\\frac{1}{3}$$\\n\\nWe can choose any values for A, B, and C that satisfy both of these conditions. One approach is to use the slope equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the others. Rearranging the slope equation, we get:\\n\\ny2 - y1 $$=$$ (-1/3)(x2 - x1)\\n\\nSubstituting in the point (1, 1/3) for (x1, y1), we get:\\n\\ny2 - $$\\frac{1}{3}$$ $$=$$ (-1/3)(x2 - 1)\\n\\nMultiplying both sides by $$3$$ to eliminate the fractions, we get:\\n\\n3y2 - $$1$$ $$=$$ -x2 + $$1$$\\n\\nRearranging, we get:\\n\\nx2 + 3y2 $$=$$ $$2$$\\n\\nTherefore, we can take A $$=$$ $$1$$, B $$=$$ $$3$$, and C $$=$$ $$2$$ to get the equation of the line in standard form:\\n\\n$$x$$ + $$3y$$ $$=$$ $$2$$\\n\\nAlternatively, we could have chosen different values for A, B, and C that also satisfy the conditions. For example, we could have used A $$=$$ $$-1$$, B $$=$$ $$3$$, and C $$=$$ $$-1$$ to get:\\n\\n$$-x$$ + $$3y$$ $$=$$ $$-1$$\\n\\nThis form is equivalent to the first equation, since we can multiply both sides by $$-1$$ to get:\\n\\n$$x$$ - $$3y$$ $$=$$ $$1$$\\n\\nEither way, we have found an equation for the line in standard form.",
