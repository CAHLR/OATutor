    "body": "Suppose you play a game of chance in which five numbers are chosen from $$0$$, $$1$$, $$2$$, $$3$$, $$4$$, $$5$$, $$6$$, $$7$$, $$8$$, $$9$$. A computer randomly selects five numbers from zero to nine with replacement. You pay $2 to play and could profit $100,000 if you match all five numbers in order (you get your $2 back plus $100,000). The expected value table below is provided. We can calculate the probabilities by calculating (1)((10)**(-5)=0.00001 for profit and $$1-0.00001=0.99999$$ for loss.\\n##figure1.gif",
