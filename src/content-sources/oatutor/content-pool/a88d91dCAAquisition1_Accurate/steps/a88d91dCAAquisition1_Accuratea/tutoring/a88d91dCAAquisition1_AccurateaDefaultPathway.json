        "text": "To find the equation in slope-intercept form, we first need to find the slope of the line.\\n\\nslope $$=$$ (change in y)/(change in x) $$=$$ $$\\frac{4-\\left(-3\\right)}{3-0}$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{7}{3}$$\\n\\nNow we can use the point-slope form of the equation:\\n\\n$$y$$ - y1 $$=$$ m(x - x1)\\n\\nwhere $$m$$ is the slope and (x1, y1) is one of the given points. Let's use point $$(3,4)$$:\\n\\n$$y$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ (7/3)(x - 3)\\n\\nNow we can solve for $$y$$ and simplify:\\n\\n$$y$$ - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{7}{3} x$$ - $$7$$\\n$$y$$ $$=$$ $$\\frac{7}{3} x$$ - $$3$$\\n\\nThis is the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.",
