Therefore, we must integrate the absolute value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled. To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance. First, find the $$t-intercept$$ of the function, since that is where the division of the interval occurs. Set the equation equal to zero and solve for $$t$$. Thus,",
