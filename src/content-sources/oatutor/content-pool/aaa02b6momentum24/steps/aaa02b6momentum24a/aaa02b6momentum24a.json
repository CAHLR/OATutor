    "stepTitle": "Ernest Rutherford (the first New Zealander to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry) demonstrated that nuclei were very small and dense by scattering helium-4 nuclei (4He) from gold-197 nuclei (197Au). the energy of the incoming helium nucleus was 8.00\u00d710**-13 J, and the masses of the helium and gold nuclei were 6.68\u00d710**-27 kg and 3.29\u00d710**-25 kg, respectively (note that their mass ratio is $$4$$ to 197). If a helium nucleus scatters to an angle of 120\u00ba during an elastic collision with a gold nucleus, calculate the helium nucleus\u2019s final speed and the final velocity (magnitude and direction) of the gold nucleus.",
