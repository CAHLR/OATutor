        "text": "$$1$$. A standard deck contains $$52$$ cards in total.\\n$$2$$. The cards are comprised of the following ranks: A, $$2$$, $$3$$, $$4$$, $$5$$, $$6$$, $$7$$, $$8$$, $$9$$, $$10$$, J, Q, K.\\n$$3$$. By definition, the \u201cnumber cards\u201d in this problem are those ranked $$2-10$$.\\n$$4$$. Thus, in each suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades), there are $$9$$ distinct number cards (2, $$3$$, $$4$$, $$5$$, $$6$$, $$7$$, $$8$$, $$9$$, 10).\\n$$5$$. Since there are $$4$$ suits, the total number of number cards is $$9$$ \u00d7 $$4$$ $$=$$ $$36$$.\\n$$6$$. Consequently, the probability of selecting a number card in one draw from a well-shuffled deck is $$\\frac{36}{52}$$.\\n$$7$$. This fraction can be simplified to $$\\frac{9}{13}$$.\\n\\n...",
