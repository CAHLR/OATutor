        "text": "The linear function is defined by $$L(x)=f{\\left(a\\right)}+\\operatorname{f'}\\left(a\\right) \\left(x-a\\right)$$. This function L is also known as the linearization of f at $$x=a$$. When the linear approximation function is constant, $$\\operatorname{f'}\\left(a\\right) \\left(x-a\\right)=0$$ such that $$f'(a)=0$$.",
