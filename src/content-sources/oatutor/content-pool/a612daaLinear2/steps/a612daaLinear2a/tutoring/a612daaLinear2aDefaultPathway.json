        "text": "To determine whether the value $$y=\\frac{3}{5}$$ is a solution to the equation $$5y+3=10y-4$$, we can substitute $$\\frac{3}{5}$$ for $$y$$ in the equation and see if it results in a true statement.\\nSubstituting $$\\frac{3}{5}$$ for $$y$$ in the equation $$5y+3=10y-4$$ gives us:\\n$$5\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)+3=\\operatorname{10}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)-4$$\\nThis simplifies to:\\n$$3+3=6-4$$\\nWhich simplifies to:\\n$$6=2$$\\nThis is not a true statement, so $$y=\\frac{3}{5}$$ is not a solution to the equation $$5y+3=10y-4$$.",
