    "stepTitle": "Which of the following statements about atomic size (atomic radius) is/are correct? Select all that apply.: A. The atomic radius of magnesium (Ca) is smaller than that of sodium (K) because Ca has more protons, pulling the electrons closer, B. Fluorine (F) has a larger atomic radius than lithium (Li) because it has more electrons, C. As you move down Group $$2$$ (alkaline earth metals) on the periodic table, the atomic radius increases due to the addition of electron shells, D. The atomic radius decreases across a period from left to right because the increasing nuclear charge pulls electrons closer without adding new energy levels, E. Nitrogen (N) has a larger atomic radius than phosphorus (P) because it is higher on the periodic table.",
