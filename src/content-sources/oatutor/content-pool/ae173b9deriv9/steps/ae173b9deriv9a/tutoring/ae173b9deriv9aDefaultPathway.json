        "text": "Now that we know that the time intervals in which the particle is moving right to left is $$2$$ to $$4$$, we must now construct this into a cohesive range statement. Square brackets mean that the end point is included, and round parentheses mean that it is excluded. Infinity symbols are always accompanied by round (exclusive) brackets, and U is used to combine intervals. Thus, the time interval is $$(2,4)$$.",
