    "body": "These problems are generally harder, often highlighting an important subtlety. If we wanted to justify the claim that the composition of two odd functions is another odd function, i.e. if f and g are odd functions, then f $$\\circ$$ g is an odd function, we could show the following steps:\\n\\n(f $$\\circ$$ $$g)(-x)=f(g(-x))=f(-g(x))=-f(g(x))=-(f$$ $$\\circ$$ g(x))\\n\\nGive justification for each step. The first step is done for you.\\n\\n(f $$\\circ$$ $$g)(-x)=f(g(-x))$$ is true by the definition of function composition.",
