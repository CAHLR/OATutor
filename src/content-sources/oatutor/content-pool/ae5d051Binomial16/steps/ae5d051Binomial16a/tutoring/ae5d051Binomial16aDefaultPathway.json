        "text": "What would we consider as a \"success\" in $$1$$ trial of this situation? By the way the situation is presented, it is fairly clear that saving money is considered a success. This is because the probability of saving money was brought up before the probability of spending money. In addition, this means that a \"failure\" would be an American spending their money.",
