        "text": "Cramer\u2019s Rule is a method that uses determinants to solve systems of equations that have the same number of equations as variables. Consider a system of two linear equations in two variables.\\n$$a1 x+b1 y+c2 z=d1$$, $$a2 x+b2 y+c2 z=d2$$, $$a3 x+b2 y+c2 z=d3$$. The solution using Cramer\u2019s Rule is given as x=Dx/D,D!=0; \u200b\u200by=Dy/D,D!=0; z=Dz/D,D!=0;. If we are solving for $$x$$, the $$x$$ column is replaced with the constant column. If we are solving for $$y$$, the $$y$$ column is replaced with the constant column. Same idea for $$z$$.\\nD: determinant of the coefficient matrix\\nDx: determinant of the numerator in the solution of $$x$$\\nDy: determinant of the numerator in the solution of $$y$$\\nDz: determinant of the numerator in the solution of $$z$$",
