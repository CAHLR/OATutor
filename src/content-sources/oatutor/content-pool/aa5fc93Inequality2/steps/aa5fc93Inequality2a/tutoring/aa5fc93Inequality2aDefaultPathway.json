Combine the inequalities: Since both must be satisfied at the same time, we express this as:\\n$$1$$ $$ \\leq $$ $$x$$ < $$3$$\\n\\n$$3$$. Interpret in interval notation: The smallest $$x$$ can be is $$1$$, and it can reach $$1$$ (because of $$\u201c \\geq \u201d)$$, but it must be strictly less than $$3$$ (because of \u201c< 3\u201d), so the interval is:\\n[1, 3)\\n\\nAnswer (in interval notation): [1, 3)",
