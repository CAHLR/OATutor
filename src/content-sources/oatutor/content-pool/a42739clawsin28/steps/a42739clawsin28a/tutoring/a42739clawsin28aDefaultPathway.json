        "title": "Understanding Right Triangles",
        "text": "Right triangles are triangles where one angle is exactly 90\u00b0. These triangles are special because they allow us to use basic trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent to relate the angles and sides. In addition, the Pythagorean Theorem can be used to find the length of a missing side when two sides are known.",
