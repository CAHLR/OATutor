To do this, we can use the dimensions of the tower to find some point (x,y) that lies on the hyperbola. We will use the top right corner of the tower to represent that point. Since the y-axis bisects the tower, our x-value can be represented by the radius of the top, or $$36$$ meters. The y-value is represented by the distance from the origin to the top, which is given as $$79.6$$ meters. We can thus substitute $$(36, 79.6)$$ and $$a=30$$ into our equation to solve for $$b$$.",
