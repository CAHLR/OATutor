    "stepTitle": "Hydrogen behaves as an ideal gas at temperatures greater than $$200$$ K and at pressures less than $$50$$ atm. Suppose $$6.00$$ mol hydrogen is initially contained in a 100-L vessel at a pressure of $$2.00$$ atm. The gas is cooled reversibly at constant pressure from its initial state to a volume of $$50.0$$ L.\\n\\nThe average molar heat capacity of hydrogen at constant pressure, $$c_P$$, is $$29.3$$ J $$K^{-1}$$ $${mol}^{-1}$$ in the temperature range of this problem. Calculate the internal energy change of the gas, \u0394U, in joules.",
