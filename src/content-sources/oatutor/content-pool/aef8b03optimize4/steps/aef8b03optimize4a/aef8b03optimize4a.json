    "stepTitle": "Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge customers $$p$$ dollars per day to rent a car, where $$50 \\leq p \\leq 200$$, the number of cars $$n$$ they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function $$n(p)=1000-5p$$. If they charge $50 per day or less, they will rent all their cars. If they charge $200 per day or more, they will not rent any cars. Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between $50 per day and $200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?",
