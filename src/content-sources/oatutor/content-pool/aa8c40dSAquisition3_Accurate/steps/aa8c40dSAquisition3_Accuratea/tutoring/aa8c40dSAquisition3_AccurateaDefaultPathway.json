        "text": "To determine if events A and B are independent, we use the formula:\\n\\nP(A AND B) $$=$$ P(A) * P(B)\\n\\nIf this equation holds, then the events are independent. If not, they are dependent.\\n\\nIn this case, we have:\\n\\nP(A AND B) $$=$$ $$0.02$$\\nP(A) $$=$$ $$0.1$$\\nP(B) $$=$$ $$0.2$$\\n\\nSo, to check if the events are independent, we plug in the values:\\n\\n$$0.02$$ $$=$$ $$0.1$$ * $$0.2$$\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\n$$0.02$$ $$=$$ $$0.02$$\\n\\nSince the equation holds, we conclude that events A and B are independent.",
