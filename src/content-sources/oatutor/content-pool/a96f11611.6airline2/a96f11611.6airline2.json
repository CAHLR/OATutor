    "body": "Suppose an airline claims that its flights are consistently on time with an average delay of at most $$15$$ minutes. It claims that the average delay is so consistent that the variance is no more than $$150$$ minutes. Doubting the consistency part of the claim, a disgruntled traveler calculates the delays for his next $$25$$ flights. The average delay for those $$25$$ flights is $$22$$ minutes with a standard deviation of $$15$$ minutes.",
