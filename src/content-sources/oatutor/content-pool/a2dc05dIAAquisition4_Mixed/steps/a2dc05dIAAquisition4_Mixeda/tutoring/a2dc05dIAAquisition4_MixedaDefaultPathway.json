        "text": "First, we distribute the coefficients and simplify each side of the equation:\\n\\n8q + $$8$$ - $$5$$ $$=$$ 6q - $$12$$ - $$1$$\\n\\nSimplifying further, we combine like terms and simplify:\\n\\n8q + $$3$$ $$=$$ 6q - $$13$$\\n\\nSubtracting 6q from both sides, we get:\\n\\n2q + $$3$$ $$=$$ $$-13$$\\n\\nSubtracting $$3$$ from both sides, we get:\\n\\n2q $$=$$ $$-16$$\\n\\nFinally, dividing both sides by $$2$$, we get:\\n\\nq $$=$$ $$-8$$\\n\\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is q $$=$$ $$-8$$.",
