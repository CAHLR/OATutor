    "body": "Suppose that you are looking for a student at your college who lives within five miles of you. You know that\\n55% of the 25,000 students do live within five miles of you. You randomly contact students from the college\\nuntil one says he or she lives within five miles of you. What is the probability that you need to contact four\\npeople?\\nThis is a geometric problem because you may have a number of failures before you have the one success you desire. Also, the probability of a success stays the same each time you ask a student if he or she lives within\\nfive miles of you. There is no definite number of trials (number of times you ask a student).",
