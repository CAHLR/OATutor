        "text": "There are different methods to find the equation of a line passing through two given points, but one possible way is:\\n\\n- Use the slope-intercept form $$y$$ $$=$$ mx + $$b$$, where $$m$$ is the slope of the line and $$b$$ is the y-intercept.\\n- To find the slope, use the formula $$m$$ $$=$$ (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the given points.\\n- If the denominator (x2 - x1) is zero, the line is vertical and its equation is $$x$$ $$=$$ a, where a is the x-coordinate of the vertical line.\\n- If the denominator is non-zero, the slope is defined and we can use either point to find the y-intercept $$b$$ by substituting in the equation $$y$$ $$=$$ mx + $$b$$.\\n- Once we have $$m$$ and $$b$$, we can write the equation of the line.\\n\\nUsing this method for the given points $$(1,-3)$$ and $$(1,4)$$, we get:\\n\\n- x1 $$=$$ $$1$$, y1 $$=$$ $$-3$$\\n- x2 $$=$$ $$1$$, y2 $$=$$ $$4$$\\n\\nThe denominator is zero, which means the line is vertical and its equation is $$x$$ $$=$$ $$1$$. Alternatively, we can say that the slope is undefined or $$infinite$$, since the rise (y2 - y1) is non-zero but the run (x2 - x1) is zero, and division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the line is a vertical line passing through the point $$(1,-3)$$ and $$(1,4)$$.\\n\\nNote that a vertical line cannot be written in slope-intercept form, but it can be written in other forms such as standard form or point-slope form.",
