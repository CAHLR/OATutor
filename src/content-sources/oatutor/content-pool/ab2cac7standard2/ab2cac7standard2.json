    "body": "Some doctors believe that a person can lose five pounds, on the average, in a month by reducing his or her fat intake and by exercising consistently. Suppose weight loss has a normal distribution. Let $$X=the$$ amount of weight lost (in pounds) by a person in a month. Use a standard deviation of two pounds. $$X~N(5,2)$$. Fill in the blanks. Suppose a person lost ten pounds in a month. The $$z-score$$ when $$x=10$$ pounds is $$z=2.5$$ (verify). This $$z-score$$ tells you that $$x=10$$ is $$___$$ standard deviations to the $$___$$ (right or left) of the mean $$___$$ (What is the mean?).",
