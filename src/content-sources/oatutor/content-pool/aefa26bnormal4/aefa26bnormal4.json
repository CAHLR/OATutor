    "body": "The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for a cell phone measures the amount of radio frequency (RF) energy absorbed by the user\u2019s body when using the handset. Every cell phone emits RF energy. Different phone models have different SAR measures. To receive certification from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for sale in the United States, the SAR level for a cell phone must be no more than $$1.6$$ watts per kilogram. Table $$8.1$$ shows the highest SAR level for a random selection of cell phone models as measured by the FCC.\\n##figure1.gif",
