        "text": "1) First, note the raw data indicating how many books each of $$50$$ part-time students bought. The data values are $$1$$, $$2$$, $$3$$, $$4$$, $$5$$, and $$6$$.\\n\\n2) Because these data values are integers, we adjust the starting and ending points of our intervals for the histogram by subtracting $$0.5$$ from the smallest data value (1) and adding $$0.5$$ to the largest data value (6). Therefore, the lower boundary is $$0.5$$ and the upper boundary is $$6.5$$.\\n\\n3) We choose a class (bar) width of $$1$$ so that each integer data value (from $$1$$ through 6) falls in the middle of its corresponding interval. This results in the following intervals for the histogram:\\n\u2022 $$0.5$$ to $$1.5$$ (contains the value 1)\\n\u2022 $$1.5$$ to $$2.5$$ (contains the value 2)\\n\u2022 $$2.5$$ to $$3.5$$ (contains the value 3)\\n\u2022 $$3.5$$ to $$4.5$$ (contains the value 4)\\n\u2022 $$4.5$$ to $$5.5$$ (contains the value 5)\\n\u2022 $$5.5$$ to $$6.5$$ (contains the value 6)\\n\\n4) Hence, the value $$4$$ is positioned in the middle of the interval from $$3.5$$ to $$4.5$$.\\n...",
