        "text": "The y-intercept of the equation $$y=-\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) x-4$$ is $$(-4,0)$$. The y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis, and in this case, the x-coordinate of the y-intercept is $$0$$. The y-coordinate of the y-intercept is the constant term in the equation, which is $$-4$$.",
