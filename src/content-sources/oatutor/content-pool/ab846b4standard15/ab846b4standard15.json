Male heights are known to follow a normal distribution. Let $$X=the$$ height of a $$15$$ to 18-year-old male from Chile in $$2009$$ to $$2010$$. Then X~N(170, $$6.28)$$. Suppose that the height of a $$15$$ to 18-year-old male from Chile from $$2009$$ to $$2010$$ has a $$z-score$$ of $$z=-2$$. What is the male\u2019s height? The $$z-score$$ $$(z=-2)$$ tells you that the male\u2019s height is $$___$$ standard deviations to the $$___$$ (right or left) of the mean.",
