        "text": "To solve this equation, we need to get the variable (in this case, m) on one side of the equals sign and all the constants on the other side. First, we can distribute the $$2$$ on the left side of the equation to get:\\n$$2m-8+3=-1$$\\nThen, we can combine like terms to get:\\n$$2m-5=-1$$\\nFinally, we can add $$5$$ to both sides to solve for m:\\n$$2m=4$$\\nDividing both sides by $$2$$ gives us the solution:\\n$$m=2$$\\nSo the solution to the equation is $$m=2$$.",
