The probability that they play zero days is $$0.2$$, the probability that they play one day is $$0.5$$, and the probability that they play two days is $$0.3$$. Let the random variable X $$=$$ the number of days the men's soccer team plays soccer per week. X takes the values $$0$$, $$1$$, $$2$$. In the table, we have rows for values of X, $$P(X=x)$$, and x*P(X=x).\\n##figure1.gif",
