    "body": "A high school assistant principal is leading a professional development session on grading equity. To illustrate probability concepts, she creates a simulation involving course placement decisions. She places $$12$$ blue cards labeled \u201cHonors Placement\u201d and $$12$$ white cards labeled \u201cGeneral Placement\u201d into a container. Teachers are asked to calculate the probability of randomly selecting an Honors card before any selections occur. The assistant principal explains that the probability can be determined solely from the known number of cards in the container and does not require observing actual draws.\\n",
