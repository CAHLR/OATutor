The other side of the cell contains a Copper electrode immersed in aqueous Copper (II) sulfate solution. In this reaction, Zinc is the anode and Copper is the cathode. Write equations showing the half-reactions that take place at each electrode. Include phase symbols ( $$\\frac{\\frac{s}{aq}}{l}$$ etc)",
