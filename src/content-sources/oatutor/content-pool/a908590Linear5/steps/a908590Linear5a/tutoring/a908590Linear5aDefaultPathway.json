        "text": "To solve this equation, we need to get all of the terms with $$p$$ on one side and all of the constants on the other side.\\nFirst, let's start by combining like terms on each side:\\n$$6(p-3)-7=5\\left(4p+3\\right)-12$$\\n$$6p-18-7=20p+15-12$$\\nNext, let's move all of the $$p$$ terms to the left side and all of the constants to the right side:\\n$$6p-7-18=20p-12+15$$\\nFinally, let's combine the like terms:\\n$$6p-25=20p+3$$\\nNow we can solve for $$p$$ by subtracting $$6p$$ from both sides and adding $$25$$ to both sides:\\n$$-14p=28$$\\nTo solve for $$p$$, we divide both sides by -14:\\n$$p=-2$$\\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is $$p=-2$$.",
