    "body": "These questions are challenging, requiring mastery of each concept and their interrelations. Note that since $$0<1$$ $$\\leq$$ $$x^2+1$$ for all values of $$x$$, the algebraic properties of inequalities imply that $$0<\\frac{1}{x^2+1}$$ $$\\leq$$ $$\\frac{1}{1}=1$$. Thus, the function $$g(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2+1}$$ is bounded.",
