The data values are $$1$$, $$2$$, $$3$$, $$4$$, $$5$$, and $$6$$.\\n\\n2) Because these data values are integers, we adjust the starting and ending points of our intervals for the histogram by subtracting $$0.5$$ from the smallest data value (1) and adding $$0.5$$ to the largest data value (6). Therefore, the lower boundary is $$0.5$$ and the upper boundary is $$6.5$$.\\n...",
