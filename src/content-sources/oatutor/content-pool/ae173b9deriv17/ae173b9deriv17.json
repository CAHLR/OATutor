    "body": "The position function s(t) $$=$$ $$t^2$$ - $$3t$$ - $$4$$ represents the position of the back of a car backing out of a driveway and then driving in a straight line, where s is in feet and $$t$$ is in seconds. In this case, s(t) $$=$$ $$0$$ represents the time at which the back of the car is at the garage door, so s(0) $$=$$ $$-4$$ is the starting position of the car, $$4$$ feet inside the garage.",
