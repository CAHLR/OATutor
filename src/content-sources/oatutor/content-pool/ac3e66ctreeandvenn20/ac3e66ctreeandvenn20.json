    "body": "A person with type O blood and a negative Rh factor $$(Rh-)$$ can donate blood to any person with any blood type. Four percent of African Americans have type O blood and a negative RH factor, $$5-10\\%$$ of African Americans have the Rh- factor, and 51% have type O blood. The \"O\" circle represents the African Americans with type O blood. The \"Rh-\" oval represents the African Americans with the Rh- factor. We will take the average of 5% and 10% and use $$7.5\\%$$ as the percent of African Americans who have the Rh- factor. Let O $$=$$ African American with type O blood and R $$=$$ African American with Rh- factor.\\n##figure1.gif",
