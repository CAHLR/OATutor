When you graph an outlier, it will appear not to fit the pattern of the graph. Some outliers are due to actual mistakes (for example, writing down $$50$$ instead of 500) while others may indicate that something unusual is happening. While outliers or extreme points may be errors or some kind of abnormality, they may also be a key to understanding the data.",
