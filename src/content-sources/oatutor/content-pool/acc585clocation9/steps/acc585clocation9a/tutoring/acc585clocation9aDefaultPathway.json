We want to know three values once the list is ordered (which is already is from least to greatest): $$x=the$$ number of data values counting from the bottom of the data list up to but not including the data value for which you want to find the percentile; $$y=the$$ number of data values equal to the data value for which you want to find the percentile; $$n=the$$ total number of data. Then, we can use the formula to calculate the percentile as $$100\\frac{x+0.5y}{n}$$. If the percentile is not an integer, round to the nearest integer.",
