It is determined by the equation $$EI=\\operatorname{log2}\\left(\\frac{f^2}{t}\\right)$$, where f is the \u201cf-stop\u201d setting on the camera, and $$t$$ is the exposure time in seconds. Suppose the f-stop setting is $$8$$ and the desired exposure time is $$2$$ seconds. What will the resulting exposure index be?",
