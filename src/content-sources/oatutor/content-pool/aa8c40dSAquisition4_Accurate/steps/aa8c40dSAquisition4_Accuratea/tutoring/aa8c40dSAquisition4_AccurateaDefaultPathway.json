        "text": "No, events A and B are not independent. If they were independent, then the probability of A AND B would be equal to the product of the probabilities of A and B, i.e. P(A AND B) $$=$$ P(A) $$x$$ P(B). But in this case, P(A AND B) $$=$$ $$0.1$$ while P(A) $$x$$ P(B) $$=$$ $$0.5$$ $$x$$ $$0.5$$ $$=$$ $$0.25$$, which are not equal. Therefore, events A and B are dependent.",
