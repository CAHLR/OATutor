        "text": "After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do not seem to approach any one single value. It appears the limit does not exist. Before drawing this conclusion, let\u2019s take a more systematic approach. Take the following sequence of x-values approaching 0: $$\\frac{2}{\\pi}$$, $$\\frac{2}{3} \\pi$$, $$\\frac{2}{5} \\pi$$, $$\\frac{2}{7} \\pi$$, $$\\frac{2}{9} \\pi$$, $$\\frac{2}{11} \\pi$$, ... The corresponding y-values are $$1$$, $$-1$$, $$1$$, $$-1$$, $$1$$, $$-1$$, ... At this point we can indeed conclude that $$lim_x$$ \u2192 $$0$$ $$sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$$ does not exist. Thus, we would write $$lim_x$$ \u2192 $$0$$ $$sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$$ DNE. The graph of f(x) $$=$$ $$sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$$ is shown in the figure and gives a clearer picture of the behavior of $$sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$$ as $$x$$ approaches $$0$$. You can see that $$sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$$ oscillates ever more wildly between $$-1$$ and $$1$$ as $$x$$ approaches $$0$$.\\n##figure3.gif##",
