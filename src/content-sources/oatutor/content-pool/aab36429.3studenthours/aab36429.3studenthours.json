    "body": "It is believed that students at a local college get less than seven hours of sleep per night, on average. A survey of $$22$$ students generated a mean of $$7.24$$ hours with a standard deviation of $$1.93$$ hours. A campus wide required study reveals that the standard deviation of the college students' sleep hours $$1.4$$ hours and that the data follows an approximately normal curve. Consider the mean hours of sleep as $$m$$ and the random variable $$x$$ as the college students' sleep hours.",
