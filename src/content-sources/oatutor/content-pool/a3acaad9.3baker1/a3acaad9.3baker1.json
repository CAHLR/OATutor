    "body": "Suppose a baker claims that his bread height is more than $$15$$ cm, on average. Several of his customers do not believe him. To persuade his customers that he is right, the baker decides to do a hypothesis test. He bakes $$10$$ loaves of bread. The mean height of the sample loaves is $$17$$ cm. The baker knows from baking hundreds of loaves of bread that the standard deviation for the height is $$0.5$$ cm, and the distribution of heights is normal.",
