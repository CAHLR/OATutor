        "text": "To solve for \ud835\udc5a, we first need to simplify the left side of the equation:\\n\\n(2/3)(3\ud835\udc5a-6) $$=$$ 2\ud835\udc5a - $$4$$\\n\\nSubstituting this into the original equation, we get:\\n\\n2\ud835\udc5a - $$4$$ $$=$$ $$5$$ - \ud835\udc5a\\n\\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get:\\n\\n3\ud835\udc5a $$=$$ $$9$$\\n\\n\ud835\udc5a $$=$$ $$3$$\\n\\nTherefore, the solution is \ud835\udc5a $$=$$ $$3$$.",
