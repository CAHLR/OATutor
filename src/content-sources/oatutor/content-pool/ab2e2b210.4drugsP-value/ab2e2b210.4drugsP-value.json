    "body": "A new AIDS prevention drug was tried on a group of $$224$$ HIV positive patients. Forty-five patients developed AIDS after four years. In a control group of $$224$$ HIV positive patients, $$68$$ developed AIDS after four years. We want to test whether the method of treatment reduces the proportion of patients that develop AIDS after four years or if the proportions of the treated group and the untreated group stay the same.",
