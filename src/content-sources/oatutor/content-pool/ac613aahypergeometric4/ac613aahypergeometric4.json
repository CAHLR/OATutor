    "body": "Suppose a shipment of $$100$$ DVD players is known to have ten defective players. An inspector randomly chooses $$12$$ for inspection. He is interested in determining the probability that, among the $$12$$ players, at most two are defective. The two groups are the $$90$$ non-defective DVD players and the $$10$$ defective DVD players. The group of interest (first group) is the defective group because the probability question asks for the probability of at most two defective DVD players. The size of the sample is $$12$$ DVD players. (They may be non-defective or defective.) Let X $$=$$ the number of defective DVD players in the sample of $$12$$. X takes on the values $$0$$, $$1$$, $$2$$, ..., $$10$$. X may not take on the values $$11$$ or $$12$$. The sample size is $$12$$, but there are only $$10$$ defective DVD players.",
