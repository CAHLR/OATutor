        "text": "To determine if events A and B are independent, we need to check if the probability of A given B (or vice versa) is the same as the probability of A without any knowledge of B. In other words, we need to check if:\\n\\nP(A|B) $$=$$ P(A)\\n\\nIf A and B are independent, then knowing that one event has occurred should not change the probability of the other event occurring.\\n\\nHowever, the information given does not allow us to determine if A and B are independent. We only know the probabilities of A, B, and their intersection, but not how they are related. To check if they are independent, we would also need to know the conditional probabilities, such as P(A|B) and P(B|A).\\n\\nTherefore, we cannot determine if events A and B are independent based on the given information.",
