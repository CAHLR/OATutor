        "text": "To determine if events A and B are independent, we need to see if the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other event occurring.\\n\\nThe formula for independent events is P(A AND B) $$=$$ P(A) \u00d7 P(B).\\n\\nSo, let's plug in the given probabilities:\\n\\nP(A AND B) $$=$$ $$0.08$$\\nP(A) $$=$$ $$0.4$$\\nP(B) $$=$$ $$0.2$$\\n\\nP(A AND B) $$=$$ P(A) \u00d7 P(B)\\n$$0.08$$ $$=$$ $$0.4$$ \u00d7 $$0.2$$\\n\\nThe equation is false, which means events A and B are dependent.\\n\\nTherefore, learning Spanish affects the probability of learning German and vice versa. Knowing that someone is learning Spanish tells us something about the likelihood of them learning German, and vice versa.",
