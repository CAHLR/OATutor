    "body": "These problems are generally harder, often highlighting an important subtlety. Every quadratic function $$f(x)=a x^2+b x+c$$ (where a not equal to 0) can be built by applying a composition of transformations to the most basic parabola, $$y=x^2$$. Let's explore this with another specific example, $$f(x)=3x^2+12x+7$$.",
