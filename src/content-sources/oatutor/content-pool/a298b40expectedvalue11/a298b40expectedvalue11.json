    "body": "Suppose you play a game with a spinner. You play each game by spinning the spinner once. $$P(red)=\\frac{2}{5}$$, $$P(blue)=\\frac{2}{5}$$, and $$P(green)=\\frac{1}{5}$$. If you land on red, you pay $10. If you land on blue, you don't pay or win anything. If you land on green, you win $10. We want to find how much we expect to earn in the process. Let's complete the expected value table provided.\\n##figure1.gif",
