        "text": "To determine whether the value $$y=\\frac{4}{3}$$ is a solution to the equation $$9y+2=6y+3$$, we can substitute $$\\frac{4}{3}$$ for $$y$$ in the equation and see if it holds true.\\nSubstituting $$\\frac{4}{3}$$ for $$y$$ in the equation gives us:\\n$$9\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)+2=6\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)+3$$\\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\\n$$12+2=8+3$$\\nWhich simplifies to:\\n$$14=11$$\\nSince $$14$$ does not equal $$11$$, $$y=\\frac{4}{3}$$ is not a solution to the equation $$9y+2=6y+3$$.",
