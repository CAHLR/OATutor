    "body": "Suppose a game has two outcomes, win or lose. You repeatedly play that game until you lose. The\\nprobability of losing is $$p$$ $$=$$ $$0.57$$.\\nIf we let X $$=$$ the number of games you play until you lose (includes the losing game), then X is a geometric random variable. All three characteristics are met. Each game you play is a Bernoulli trial, either win or lose.\\nYou would need to play at least one game before you stop. X takes on the values $$1$$, $$2$$, $$3$$, . (could go on\\nindefinitely). Since we are measuring the number of games you play until you lose, we define a success as\\nlosing a game and a failure as winning a game. The probability of a success $$p$$ $$=$$ $$.57$$ and the probability of a failure q $$=$$ $$1$$ - $$p$$ $$=$$ $$1$$ - $$0.57$$ $$=$$ $$0.43$$. Both $$p$$ and q remain the same from game to game.",
