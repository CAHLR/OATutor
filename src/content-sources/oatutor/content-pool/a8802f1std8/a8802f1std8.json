    "body": "A study is done by a community group in two neighboring colleges to determine which one graduates students with more math classes. College A samples $$11$$ graduates. Their average is four math classes with a standard deviation of $$1.5$$ math classes. College B samples nine graduates. Their average is $$3.5$$ math classes with a standard deviation of one math class. The community group believes that a student who graduates from college A has taken more math classes, on the average. Both populations have a normal distribution. Test at a 1% significance level.",
